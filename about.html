      <h2>About Shawn Rader &amp; Mobile American Notary &amp; Apostilles</h2>
      <p class="service-detail-lead">
        Mobile American Notary &amp; Apostilles is a Los Angeles–based mobile notary and apostille service led
        by <strong>Shawn Rader</strong>, a commissioned California Notary Public serving clients since 2018.
      </p>
      <p>
        The practice focuses on mobile notarizations, apostille and legalization support for documents used
        outside the United States, hospital and jail signings, and estate and trust documents across Los Angeles,
        Orange, Ventura, and nearby counties, with appointments designed for clients who need a reliable
        <strong>mobile notary in Los Angeles, CA</strong> and apostille resource with clear communication and
        on‑time arrivals.
      </p>
      <p>
        Shawn’s background as an IT systems administrator shapes the way appointments are handled: organized,
        technology‑driven, and prepared for last‑minute changes, with a mobile printer, scanner, and laptop always
        on hand when documents need to be located or printed in urgent situations such as hospital or facility
        signings. Day‑to‑day coordination is supported by an assistant, Sammy, who usually answers calls, responds
        to emails, and helps keep the schedule and confirmations organized so appointments stay on track.
      </p>
      <p>
        Most days involve a mix of hospital and rehab notarizations, nursing‑home and in‑home visits, jail
        appointments, estate and trust signings, and simple one‑document visits across Los Angeles County and
        parts of Ventura County such as Simi Valley and Thousand Oaks, with travel extending into Riverside and
        San Bernardino counties for certain higher‑stakes or time‑sensitive appointments.

      <h2>Built Around Real‑World Signing Needs</h2>
      <p class="service-detail-lead">
        Over roughly eight years, Shawn has handled a steady mix of mobile notarizations, apostille‑related
        matters, and on‑site visits to hospitals, care facilities, and jails, along with everyday general notary
        clients.
      </p>
      <p>
        Clients have contributed more than 100 reviews over time, frequently mentioning punctuality,
        professionalism, clear communication, and the way each appointment feels prepared rather than rushed,
        even when deadlines or circumstances are stressful.
      </p>
      <p>
        In situations where documents are missing or a signer is unexpectedly hospitalized, Shawn uses a laptop
        and mobile printer to help clients locate appropriate templates from reputable online sources—such as
        powers of attorney or advance healthcare directives—and then proceed with notarization when it is
        appropriate and within California notary law.
      </p>

      <p style="margin-top:14px;"><strong>Common apostille &amp; notary appointments:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Vital records apostilles (birth, marriage, and death certificates) for use outside the United States.</li>
        <li>School and academic records for study abroad, licensing, or foreign credential evaluation.</li>
        <li>Court, adoption, and divorce documents that need to be recognized in another country.</li>
        <li>Corporate records, powers of attorney, and other business documents for international use.</li>
        <li>Hospital and rehab signings for powers of attorney and advance healthcare directives.</li>
        <li>Jail and detention signings for urgent legal and family matters.</li>

        <li>100+ client reviews noting punctuality, professionalism, and clear, consistent communication.</li>
      </ul>
      <p style="margin-top:14px;">
        Shawn focuses on combining legal compliance with practical problem‑solving, especially when timing,
        health, or logistics make an appointment more complicated than a simple walk‑in notarization. Behind the
        scenes, Sammy helps manage calls, emails, and follow‑ups so clients receive clear appointment details,
        reminders, and quick answers to basic scheduling questions.

        Mobile appointments are regularly scheduled in the San Fernando Valley, Greater Los Angeles, select areas
        of Orange County, and many cities throughout Ventura County, with travel discussed up front for each
        request. For hospital, trust, real estate, jail, and apostille‑related work, travel can extend into

      <h2>What Clients Can Expect</h2>
      <p class="service-detail-lead">
        Every notarization is completed with the same core commitments: clear communication, punctuality,
        privacy, and careful compliance with California notary rules.
      </p>
      <p>
        The guiding principle is straightforward: if a request is legal, provides real value, and is within a
        reasonable distance—or is an exceptional situation where going farther makes sense—Shawn will usually
        find a way to help or suggest a practical next step. For specific questions, you can
