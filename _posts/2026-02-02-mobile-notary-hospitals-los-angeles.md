## Common documents we notarize in hospitals and care facilities

- **Powers of attorney (financial or general):** Allow a trusted person to handle banking, bills, and other financial decisions if the signer cannot.
- **Advance healthcare directives and medical powers of attorney:** Let patients clearly state who can speak with doctors and make medical decisions if they are unable to.
- **HIPAA releases and medical information forms:** Authorize specific people to discuss treatment and medical records with the care team.
- **Facility admission or transfer forms:** Required by hospitals, rehab centers, and skilled nursing facilities when admitting or moving a patient.
- **Estate planning documents:** In some cases, clients ask to sign trusts, wills, or related documents when timing is critical.

## How we handle hospital and care-facility calls

**We gather key details on the first call.** We ask which hospital or facility, room number, document type, number of signers, whether witnesses are required, and any timing issues like upcoming surgery, discharge, or transfer.

**We coordinate around medical care and schedules.** Hospital days are unpredictable, so we build flexibility into every visit and stay in contact by phone or text to adjust timing.

**We check capacity and willingness at the bedside.** Before any document is signed, we speak directly with the patient to confirm they understand what they are signing and are signing voluntarily. If we have concerns, we will not proceed.

**We make the signing as comfortable as possible.** We work with staff and family to arrange pillows, trays, or clipboards, bring extra pens and notarial certificates, and keep the process brief.

**We troubleshoot document and ID issues on the spot.** We help families confirm acceptable ID, review documents for completeness, and attach proper notarial certificates when needed.

## Tips for families planning a hospital notarization

- Confirm with the doctor or nurse that the patient is alert enough to sign before scheduling.
- Have all pages printed and organized before we arrive.
- Make sure the signer has their original ID at the hospital or facility.
- If witnesses are required, ask a trusted friend or family member to be present.
- Let the nurse's station know what time the notary is coming.
