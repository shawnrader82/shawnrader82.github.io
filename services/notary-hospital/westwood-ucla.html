      Bedside notary visits at UCLA in Westwood
    </h2>
    <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:12px;">
      Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center is a major academic medical center located on the UCLA campus in Westwood. As the flagship hospital for UCLA Health, it provides advanced care in cardiology, oncology, neurosurgery, transplant medicine, pediatrics, and many other specialties. Patients come to UCLA from across California and the country for complex treatments, and families often need important documents notarized while care is underway.
    </p>
    <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:12px;">
      Because Westwood is in the Westside of Los Angeles and traffic between the San Fernando Valley and UCLA can be heavy, this facility is part of our Tier 2 service area. We factor additional travel and campus parking time into scheduling and pricing so we can arrive prepared and on time.

    <h2 style="font-size:22px; margin-bottom:10px;">What to expect when you book</h2>

    <div class="two-column-section">
      <div>
        <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:12px;">
          We coordinate with you by phone or text to confirm the patient's legal name, unit, and room number, as well as the documents that need notarization. Because the UCLA Health campus is large and spans multiple buildings, details like the correct tower and elevator bank are very helpful.
        </p>
        <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:12px;">
          When we arrive, we park in the appropriate UCLA structure, follow hospital visitor procedures, and then meet you in the patient room or a designated family area. Our goal is to keep the visit calm, efficient, and respectful of the medical team caring for your loved one.
        </p>
        <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:12px;">
          Westwood traffic and on-campus parking can be challenging, especially on weekdays and during UCLA events. We include time for parking and walking through the hospital in our arrival estimate and will text you when we are on-site so you know we are close.

    <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:12px;">
      Many families call from UCLA Westwood when time and mobility are limited. Typical documents include:
    </p>

    <ul style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.8; margin-left:18px; margin-bottom:16px;">
      <li>Advance healthcare directives and living wills</li>
      <li>Medical and durable powers of attorney</li>
      <li>HIPAA authorization and medical records release forms</li>
      <li>Wills, trust documents, and related estate forms</li>
      <li>Financial powers of attorney and insurance or benefit forms that require notarization</li>
      <li>Facility admission, transfer, or discharge paperwork</li>
    </ul>

    <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:12px;">
      If you are not sure whether your form needs to be notarized, you can text us a clear photo in advance so we can review the notary section.

This service includes use of my laptop, portable printer, internet connection, and platform access.

For legal questions or to decide which documents are appropriate for your situation, please consult a licensed attorney.

    <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:12px;">
      To keep your visit smooth, please have:
    </p>

    <ul style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.8; margin-left:18px; margin-bottom:16px;">
      <li>A valid, government-issued photo ID for each signer (driver license, state ID, passport, or other accepted identification)</li>
      <li>All pages of the documents printed and ready, not just the signature page (unless using our laptop/printer service)</li>
      <li>Any required witnesses who are not named in the document and who meet the hospital's visitor rules</li>
    </ul>

    <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:12px;">
      If the patient has limited mobility or is unable to sign in their usual way, let us know beforehand so we can discuss acceptable options under California notary law.
    </p>

    <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:12px;">
      If ID is at home, we recommend having a family member bring it to the hospital before the appointment. In some cases, credible witnesses may be an option; we will discuss this with you in advance based on California law.

    <h2 style="font-size:22px; margin-bottom:10px;">Mobile notary FAQ for Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center</h2>

    <div class="faq-block" style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6;">
      <p class="faq-question">Is this the same as UCLA Santa Monica Medical Center?</p>
      <p class="faq-answer">
        No. Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center is located on the main UCLA campus in Westwood, while UCLA Santa Monica Medical Center is a separate hospital a few miles away near Wilshire and 16th Street. We can serve both facilities, but this page focuses on bedside notarizations at the Westwood campus. If your family member is at the Santa Monica location, let us know when you contact us so we can quote the correct travel time and pricing.
      </p>

      <p class="faq-question">How long does it take you to get to UCLA Westwood from Granada Hills?</p>
      <p class="faq-answer">
        Travel time to Westwood usually ranges from 35-60 minutes depending on traffic on the 405 and surface streets like Sunset Boulevard or Wilshire. During rush hour or when there are events on campus, it can take longer. We check real-time conditions before confirming your arrival window and keep you updated by text if delays are expected.
      </p>

      <p class="faq-question">Can you notarize documents for patients in specialized units like transplant, neurology, or oncology?</p>
      <p class="faq-answer">
        Yes. UCLA cares for many complex transplant, neurology, and oncology patients. We can visit these units as long as hospital visitor rules allow and the patient is alert enough to understand and sign the documents. We coordinate timing with family members and, when appropriate, the nursing staff to make sure the signing does not interfere with critical treatments or procedures.
      </p>

      <p class="faq-question">Does UCLA provide its own notary service?</p>
      <p class="faq-answer">
        Large academic medical centers sometimes have internal notary options, but availability is often limited and may not cover all document types. We operate as an independent mobile notary service that you hire directly. Families often call us when hospital-based notary options are unavailable, backlogged, or restricted to certain forms.
      </p>

      <p class="faq-question">Where do you park when coming to UCLA Westwood?</p>
      <p class="faq-answer">
        We typically use UCLA visitor parking structures designated for the hospital and medical center. Parking fees and walking time are built into our arrival estimate so you do not have to worry about validating our parking. We will text you when we are parked and on the way up to the unit so you know when to expect us.
      </p>

      <p class="faq-question">Can you meet family members on campus rather than in the patient room?</p>
      <p class="faq-answer">
        Yes. If a document needs notarization but the patient is not the signer (for example, a family member signing a financial power of attorney), we can meet in a campus lobby, outdoor area, or another convenient spot. We just need each signer to bring valid ID and appear in person. If documents involve both the patient and family members, we can coordinate a sequence that works best for everyone.
