    <h2 style="font-size:24px; margin-bottom:10px;">
      Bedside notary visits in East Hollywood
    </h2>
    <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:12px;">
      CHA Hollywood Presbyterian Medical Center is a 434-bed general acute care hospital located at 1300 North Vermont Avenue in East Hollywood, near the intersection of Vermont Avenue and Sunset Boulevard. Established in 1924, it is one of the oldest hospitals in Los Angeles and is owned by the South Korea&#8211;based CHA Medical Group. The hospital employs more than 500 physicians representing virtually every specialty, including emergency care, cardiovascular services, orthopedics, women&#8217;s and children&#8217;s services, and oncology.
    </p>
    <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:12px;">
      The campus recently completed a major $400 million expansion with a new patient tower that features an expanded emergency department with 20 exam rooms (double the size of the previous ED), a chest pain observation area, and modernized inpatient units. The hospital serves the diverse, multicultural communities of Hollywood, Los Feliz, Silver Lake, Koreatown, and surrounding neighborhoods.
    </p>
    <ul style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.8; margin-left:18px; margin-bottom:16px;">
      <li><strong>Address:</strong> 1300 North Vermont Avenue, Los Angeles, CA 90027</li>
      <li><strong>Main phone:</strong> (213) 413&#8209;3000</li>
      <li><strong>Admitting:</strong> (323) 913&#8209;4950</li>
      <li><strong>Patient Relations:</strong> (323) 913&#8209;4949</li>
      <li><strong>Visiting hours:</strong> 8:00 AM &#8211; 8:00 PM daily (2 asymptomatic visitors at a time; face masks required in all patient care areas)</li>
      <li><strong>Emergency department:</strong> Open 24 hours</li>
      <li><strong>Parking:</strong> Visitor parking available on campus; street parking also accessible on Vermont Avenue</li>
    </ul>
    <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:12px;">
      Because reaching East Hollywood from Granada Hills requires navigating the 170/101 freeways and dense surface-street traffic, we include this facility in our Tier 2 service area. We build extra travel and parking time into our scheduling and pricing so we can arrive prepared and on time.

    <div class="two-column-section">
      <div>
        <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:12px;">
          We coordinate with you by phone or text to confirm the patient&#8217;s legal name, unit, and room number, along with the documents that need notarization. When we arrive, we park in visitor parking or a nearby structure, check in according to hospital visitor procedures, and meet you in the patient room or a family waiting area.
        </p>
        <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:12px;">
          Visiting hours at CHA HPMC are 8:00 AM to 8:00 PM daily, with a maximum of 2 asymptomatic visitors at a time. Face masks are required in all patient care areas. We schedule our arrival within the visiting window and bring our own masks. If the patient is in the ICU, step-down, new patient tower, or another restricted area, let us know in advance so we can plan around access rules.
        </p>
        <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:12px;">
          Traffic and parking in East Hollywood can be challenging, particularly during weekdays and evenings. We factor this into your arrival window and will text you when we are on campus so you know we are close.

      Many families call from Hollywood Presbyterian when time and mobility are limited. Typical documents include:
    </p>

    <ul style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.8; margin-left:18px; margin-bottom:16px;">

    <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:12px;">

    <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:12px;">
      To keep your visit smooth, please have:
    </p>

    <ul style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.8; margin-left:18px; margin-bottom:16px;">
      <li>A valid, government-issued photo ID for each signer (driver license, state ID, passport, or other accepted identification)</li>
      <li>All pages of the documents printed and ready, not just the signature page (unless using our laptop/printer service)</li>
      <li>Any required witnesses who are not named in the document and who meet the hospital&#8217;s visitor rules</li>
    </ul>

    <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:12px;">
      If the patient has limited mobility or is unable to sign in their usual way, let us know beforehand so we can discuss acceptable options under California notary law.
    </p>

    <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:12px;">
      If ID is at home, we recommend having a family member bring it to the hospital before the appointment. In some cases, credible witnesses may be an option; we will discuss this with you in advance based on California law.

    <h2 style="font-size:22px; margin-bottom:10px;">Mobile notary FAQ for Hollywood Presbyterian Medical Center</h2>

    <div class="faq-block" style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6;">
      <p class="faq-question">Is Hollywood Presbyterian the same as Kaiser LA or Cedars-Sinai?</p>
      <p class="faq-answer">
        No. CHA Hollywood Presbyterian Medical Center is a separate 434-bed community hospital at 1300 North Vermont Avenue in East Hollywood, owned by the South Korea&#8211;based CHA Medical Group. It is distinct from Kaiser Permanente Los Angeles Medical Center on Sunset Boulevard and Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Beverly Grove. We serve all three facilities, but each has its own location, traffic patterns, and visitor rules. Be sure to confirm which hospital your loved one is at when you contact us so we can quote the correct travel time and pricing.
      </p>

      <p class="faq-question">What are visiting hours at Hollywood Presbyterian?</p>
      <p class="faq-answer">
        Visiting hours are 8:00 AM to 8:00 PM daily. Two asymptomatic visitors are allowed at a time in all areas. Visitors may leave and re-enter the hospital during visiting hours. Face masks are required in all patient care areas regardless of vaccination status. We schedule our notary visit within these hours and bring our own masks.
      </p>

      <p class="faq-question">How long does it take you to get to Hollywood Presbyterian from Granada Hills?</p>
      <p class="faq-answer">
        Travel time to East Hollywood typically ranges from 35&#8211;55 minutes depending on 170/101 freeway traffic and local congestion near Vermont and Sunset. During rush hour or event days, it can take longer. We always check real-time conditions before confirming your arrival window and keep you updated by text if delays are expected.
      </p>

      <p class="faq-question">Can you notarize documents in the new patient tower or ICU?</p>
      <p class="faq-answer">
        Yes, we can visit patients in the new $400 million patient tower, ICU, or other specialized units as long as hospital visitor rules allow and the patient is alert enough to understand and sign the documents. The new tower features modernized inpatient rooms and an expanded emergency department. We coordinate timing with family members and, when appropriate, nursing staff to minimize disruption to care. If the medical team advises delaying the signing, we defer to their judgment and adjust our schedule.
      </p>

      <p class="faq-question">Do you serve nearby neighborhoods like Los Feliz, Silver Lake, and Koreatown?</p>
      <p class="faq-answer">
        Yes. In addition to bedside visits at Hollywood Presbyterian, we serve homes, senior communities, and medical offices in Los Feliz, Silver Lake, Echo Park, Hollywood, and Koreatown. All of these are part of our broader Los Angeles service area at Tier 2 pricing.
      </p>

      <p class="faq-question">What if parking or traffic delays your arrival?</p>
      <p class="faq-answer">
        East Hollywood can be busy, but we plan ahead. We leave extra time for parking and local congestion, and we will text you when we are parked and walking in. If an unexpected delay occurs, we keep you updated and, if necessary, adjust the timing to work around medical tests or procedures.
      </p>

      <p class="faq-question">Can you meet family members in the lobby instead of the patient room?</p>
      <p class="faq-answer">
        Yes. If the document involves a family member rather than the patient (for example, a financial power of attorney or affidavit), we can meet in the hospital lobby, cafeteria, or another quiet spot. As long as each signer appears in person with valid ID and is willing and able to sign, we can complete the notarization there.
