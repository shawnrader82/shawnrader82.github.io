      Bedside notary visits in Valencia and Santa Clarita
    </h2>
    <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:12px;">
      Henry Mayo Newhall Hospital is the primary hospital serving the Santa Clarita Valley, located at 23845 McBean Parkway in Valencia. The facility includes emergency services, surgical care, a cardiac catheterization lab, maternity services, and a wide range of inpatient units. For families and patients in Valencia, Newhall, Saugus, Canyon Country, Stevenson Ranch, and Castaic, Henry Mayo is often the closest hospital when urgent medical situations arise.
    </p>
    <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:12px;">
      As one of our Tier 1 (nearby) hospitals, Henry Mayo is accessible via the I-5 from our Granada Hills base, which means we can often respond quickly for same-day or next-day appointments depending on traffic conditions through the Newhall Pass.

    <div class="two-column-section">
      <div>
        <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:12px;">
          We coordinate with you by phone or text to confirm the patient's legal name, room number, and the documents that need notarization. When we arrive, we check in at the main entrance or information desk, follow hospital visitor procedures, and then meet you in the patient room or a designated family area.
        </p>
        <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:12px;">
          Our goal is to keep the visit calm, efficient, and respectful of doctors and nurses who may need access to the patient. If the patient is in the ICU, undergoing tests, or has visitor restrictions, let us know ahead of time so we can plan accordingly.
        </p>
        <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:12px;">
          Henry Mayo has surface parking lots and a visitor check-in process. Travel time from Granada Hills depends on I-5 traffic through the Newhall Pass, so we will confirm an arrival window when you book that accounts for current conditions.

    <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:12px;">
      To keep your visit smooth, please have:
    </p>

    <ul style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.8; margin-left:18px; margin-bottom:16px;">
      <li>A valid, government-issued photo ID for each signer (driver license, state ID, passport, or other accepted identification)</li>
      <li>All pages of the documents printed and ready, not just the signature page (unless using our laptop/printer service)</li>
      <li>Any required witnesses who are not named in the document and who meet the hospital's visitor rules</li>
    </ul>

    <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:12px;">
      If the patient has limited mobility or is unable to sign in their usual way, let us know beforehand so we can discuss acceptable options under California notary law.
    </p>

    <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:12px;">
      If ID is at home, we recommend having a family member bring it to the hospital before the appointment. In some cases, credible witnesses may be an option; we will discuss this with you in advance based on California law.

    <h2 style="font-size:22px; margin-bottom:10px;">Mobile notary FAQ for Henry Mayo Newhall Hospital</h2>

    <div class="faq-block" style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6;">
      <p class="faq-question">How long does it take you to get to Henry Mayo from Granada Hills?</p>
      <p class="faq-answer">
        Travel time to Valencia depends heavily on I-5 traffic through the Newhall Pass. During off-peak hours, we can typically arrive in 30-45 minutes. During rush hour or after an accident, it can take significantly longer. We always check current traffic conditions before confirming an arrival window, and we will let you know if delays are expected so you can plan accordingly.
      </p>

      <p class="faq-question">Is Henry Mayo the only hospital you serve in Santa Clarita?</p>
      <p class="faq-answer">
        Henry Mayo Newhall Hospital is the primary acute care hospital in the Santa Clarita Valley. We also serve patients at skilled nursing facilities, rehab centers, and assisted living communities throughout Valencia, Newhall, Saugus, and Canyon Country. If your family member is at a different type of facility in the area, we can likely accommodate that visit as well.
      </p>

      <p class="faq-question">Can you notarize documents for a patient being transferred to another facility?</p>
      <p class="faq-answer">
        Yes, transfer situations are common. If a patient is being moved to a rehab center, skilled nursing facility, or another hospital, families often need powers of attorney or healthcare directives notarized before the transfer. Let us know the expected transfer time so we can schedule the signing with enough buffer. If the transfer is delayed, we can adjust.
      </p>

      <p class="faq-question">What if I need a notary after hours or on a weekend at Henry Mayo?</p>
      <p class="faq-answer">
        We offer after-hours and weekend appointments for hospital visits when possible. Additional fees may apply for evening, early morning, or weekend requests. When you contact us, let us know your timing constraints and we will do our best to accommodate urgent situations outside normal business hours.
      </p>

      <p class="faq-question">Can you notarize if the patient is in the Henry Mayo emergency room?</p>
      <p class="faq-answer">
        Emergency room visits can be challenging due to unpredictable wait times, patient movement between areas, and limited privacy. If the patient has been admitted to an ER bed and is stable, we may be able to complete the notarization. We recommend waiting until the patient is moved to a regular room if possible, but we understand that urgent situations sometimes require ER visits. Contact us to discuss your specific circumstances.
      </p>

      <p class="faq-question">Do you serve other cities in the Santa Clarita Valley besides Valencia?</p>
      <p class="faq-answer">
        Yes. While Henry Mayo is located in Valencia, we serve patients and families throughout the Santa Clarita Valley, including Newhall, Saugus, Canyon Country, Stevenson Ranch, Castaic, and Agua Dulce. If the patient is discharged to a home or facility in any of these areas, we can follow up there as well.
