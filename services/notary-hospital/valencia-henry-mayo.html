        <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:12px;">
          We coordinate with you by phone or text to confirm the patient&#8217;s legal name, room number, and the documents that need notarization. When we arrive, we check in at the main entrance following the hospital&#8217;s visitor check-in procedures, and then meet you in the patient room or a designated family area.
        </p>
        <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:12px;">
          Henry Mayo offers <strong>24/7 visitation</strong> with a few exceptions. Most units allow two visitors at a time, while the Emergency Department allows one visitor per patient. This around-the-clock access gives us excellent flexibility for scheduling notary visits &#8212; including evenings, early mornings, and weekends &#8212; at times that work best for the patient and family.
        </p>
        <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:12px;">
          Our goal is to keep the visit calm, efficient, and respectful of doctors and nurses who may need access to the patient. If the patient is in the ICU, undergoing tests, or has specific visitor restrictions, let us know ahead of time so we can plan accordingly.
        </p>
        <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:12px;">
          Henry Mayo offers free parking on campus. Travel time from Granada Hills depends on I-5 traffic through the Newhall Pass, so we will confirm an arrival window when you book that accounts for current conditions.

      To keep your visit smooth, please have:
    </p>

    <ul style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.8; margin-left:18px; margin-bottom:16px;">

      If the patient has limited mobility or is unable to sign in their usual way, let us know beforehand so we can discuss acceptable options under California notary law.
    </p>

    <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:12px;">
      If ID is at home, we recommend having a family member bring it to the hospital before the appointment. In some cases, credible witnesses may be an option; we will discuss this with you in advance based on California law.

    <div class="faq-block" style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6;">
      <p class="faq-question">How long does it take you to get to Henry Mayo from Granada Hills?</p>
      <p class="faq-answer">
        Travel time to Valencia depends heavily on I-5 traffic through the Newhall Pass. During off-peak hours, we can typically arrive in 30&#8211;45 minutes. During rush hour or after an accident, it can take significantly longer. We always check current traffic conditions before confirming an arrival window, and we will let you know if delays are expected so you can plan accordingly.
      </p>

      <p class="faq-question">What are visiting hours at Henry Mayo Newhall Hospital?</p>
      <p class="faq-answer">
        Henry Mayo offers <strong>24/7 visitation</strong> with a few exceptions. Most units allow two visitors at a time. The Emergency Department allows one visitor per patient. All visitors must check in at the hospital entrance. This around-the-clock policy gives us excellent flexibility for scheduling notary visits at virtually any time &#8212; day, evening, or weekend. For questions about current visitor policies, you can also call Henry Mayo directly at (661) 200&#8209;1128.
      </p>

      <p class="faq-question">Is Henry Mayo the only hospital you serve in Santa Clarita?</p>
      <p class="faq-answer">
        Henry Mayo Newhall Hospital is the primary acute care hospital in the Santa Clarita Valley. We also serve patients at skilled nursing facilities, rehab centers, and assisted living communities throughout Valencia, Newhall, Saugus, and Canyon Country. If your family member is at a different type of facility in the area, we can likely accommodate that visit as well.
      </p>

      <p class="faq-question">Can you notarize documents for a patient being transferred to another facility?</p>
      <p class="faq-answer">
        Yes, transfer situations are common. If a patient is being moved to a rehab center, skilled nursing facility, or another hospital, families often need powers of attorney or healthcare directives notarized before the transfer. Henry Mayo has an acute rehabilitation unit on campus, so the patient may also be transitioning within the same facility. Let us know the expected transfer time so we can schedule the signing with enough buffer. If the transfer is delayed, we can adjust.
      </p>

      <p class="faq-question">What if I need a notary after hours or on a weekend at Henry Mayo?</p>
      <p class="faq-answer">
        We offer after-hours and weekend appointments for hospital visits when possible. Additional fees may apply for evening, early morning, or weekend requests. Because Henry Mayo allows visitors 24/7, scheduling flexibility at this facility is excellent. When you contact us, let us know your timing constraints and we will do our best to accommodate urgent situations outside normal business hours.

      <p class="faq-question">Can you notarize if the patient is in the Henry Mayo emergency room?</p>
      <p class="faq-answer">
        Emergency room visits can be challenging due to unpredictable wait times, patient movement between areas, and limited privacy. Henry Mayo&#8217;s ER is a Level II Trauma Center with trauma rooms and cardiac-monitored beds, and allows one visitor per patient. If the patient has been admitted to an ER bed and is stable, we may be able to complete the notarization. We recommend waiting until the patient is moved to a regular room if possible, but we understand that urgent situations sometimes require ER visits. Contact us to discuss your specific circumstances.

      <p class="faq-question">Do you serve other cities in the Santa Clarita Valley besides Valencia?</p>
      <p class="faq-answer">
        Yes. While Henry Mayo is located in Valencia, we serve patients and families throughout the Santa Clarita Valley, including Newhall, Saugus, Canyon Country, Stevenson Ranch, Castaic, and Agua Dulce. If the patient is discharged to a home or facility in any of these areas, we can follow up there as well.
