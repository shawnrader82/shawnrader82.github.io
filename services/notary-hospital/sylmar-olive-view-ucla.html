      Bedside notary visits in Sylmar
    </h2>
    <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:12px;">
      Olive View-UCLA Medical Center is a Los Angeles County-operated hospital located at 14445 Olive View Drive in Sylmar. With approximately 355 beds, the facility provides 24/7 emergency services, urgent care, surgical services, and a full range of inpatient specialties. As a teaching hospital affiliated with the UCLA David Geffen School of Medicine, Olive View serves a large and diverse patient population across the northeast San Fernando Valley, including Sylmar, San Fernando, Pacoima, and surrounding communities.
    </p>
    <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:12px;">
      Olive View is effectively our closest hospital — just minutes from our Granada Hills office. This makes it the fastest hospital for us to reach, and we can often accommodate very short-notice and same-day urgent requests here more easily than at any other facility.

    <div class="two-column-section">
      <div>
        <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:12px;">
          We coordinate with you by phone or text to confirm the patient's legal name, room number, and the documents that need notarization. When we arrive, we check in at the main entrance or security desk, follow hospital visitor procedures, and then meet you in the patient room or a designated family area.
        </p>
        <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:12px;">
          As a county hospital, Olive View may have specific visitor check-in procedures and ID requirements for guests entering the facility. We are familiar with county hospital protocols and build extra time into the visit for security screening and access. Let us know the unit and room number so we can navigate the campus efficiently.
        </p>
        <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:12px;">
          Olive View has surface parking lots. Because we are so close, travel time is minimal and we can sometimes arrive within 30-60 minutes for urgent calls during business hours.

    </p>

    <ul style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.8; margin-left:18px; margin-bottom:16px;">

    <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:12px;">

    <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:12px;">
      If you need a power of attorney, healthcare directive, or other form but do not have it ready, you can use my equipment and Rocket Lawyer access to create the document during our appointment. This service includes use of my laptop, portable printer, internet connection, and platform access. You choose which documents to create; I provide the hardware and administrative help to get the paperwork ready.

      <strong>Important:</strong> I am a commissioned notary public, not an attorney. I do not provide legal advice, recommend specific documents, or explain your legal rights.

For legal questions or to decide which documents are appropriate for your situation, please consult a licensed attorney.

    <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:12px;">
      To keep your visit smooth, please have:
    </p>

    <ul style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.8; margin-left:18px; margin-bottom:16px;">
      <li>A valid, government-issued photo ID for each signer (driver license, state ID, passport, or other accepted identification)</li>
      <li>All pages of the documents printed and ready, not just the signature page (unless using our laptop/printer service)</li>
      <li>Any required witnesses who are not named in the document and who meet the hospital's visitor rules</li>
    </ul>

    <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:12px;">
      If the patient has limited mobility or is unable to sign in their usual way, let us know beforehand so we can discuss acceptable options under California notary law.
    </p>

    <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:12px;">
      If ID is at home, we recommend having a family member bring it to the hospital before the appointment. In some cases, credible witnesses may be an option; we will discuss this with you in advance based on California law.

    <div class="service-detail-kicker">Frequently asked questions</div>
    <h2 style="font-size:22px; margin-bottom:10px;">Mobile notary FAQ for Olive View-UCLA Medical Center</h2>

    <div class="faq-block" style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6;">
      <p class="faq-question">Is Olive View the same as Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center?</p>
      <p class="faq-answer">
        No. Olive View-UCLA Medical Center is a Los Angeles County-operated hospital in Sylmar that is affiliated with UCLA for teaching purposes, but it is a completely separate facility from Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center in Westwood. Olive View is a public county hospital, while UCLA Westwood is part of the UCLA Health system. If your family member is at the Westwood campus, see our <a href="/services/notary-hospital/westwood-ucla.html">UCLA Westwood page</a> for Tier 2 pricing and details.
      </p>

      <p class="faq-question">How fast can you get to Olive View from your office?</p>
      <p class="faq-answer">
        Olive View is our closest hospital. We can typically arrive in 10-20 minutes from our Granada Hills office, making this the fastest facility for us to reach. For urgent calls during business hours, we can sometimes be at the bedside within 30-60 minutes of your initial contact, depending on our current schedule.
      </p>

      <p class="faq-question">Does Olive View have different visitor rules than private hospitals?</p>
      <p class="faq-answer">
        As a county-operated facility, Olive View may have security screening at the entrance and specific visitor ID requirements. We are familiar with county hospital procedures and carry our own government-issued ID and notary credentials. We build extra time into our visit for any security or check-in steps. If the hospital has restricted visiting hours for certain units, let us know so we can time our arrival appropriately.
      </p>

      <p class="faq-question">Can you notarize for a patient who only speaks Spanish or another language?</p>
      <p class="faq-answer">
        Olive View serves a very diverse community with many Spanish-speaking and multilingual patients. The signer must be able to communicate with the notary to confirm their identity and understanding of the document. I can communicate in basic Spanish to help facilitate the process. A bilingual family member or interpreter can also assist. We cannot notarize if there is no way to verify the signer understands what they are signing.
      </p>

      <p class="faq-question">What if the patient was brought in by ambulance and the family does not have their ID?</p>
      <p class="faq-answer">
        Emergency admissions often mean the patient's wallet or ID is at home. We recommend having a family member retrieve the ID and bring it to the hospital before the appointment. If that is not possible, California law allows for identification through credible witnesses under certain conditions. Contact us to discuss the situation and we will walk you through the options before scheduling.
      </p>

      <p class="faq-question">Do you serve other facilities in Sylmar, Pacoima, and San Fernando?</p>
      <p class="faq-answer">
        Yes. In addition to Olive View, we serve patients and families at skilled nursing facilities, rehab centers, assisted living communities, and private homes throughout Sylmar, Pacoima, San Fernando, Arleta, and the surrounding northeast Valley. These are all within our closest service area and receive Tier 1 pricing.
