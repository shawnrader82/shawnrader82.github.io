      Bedside notary visits in Woodland Hills
    </h2>
    <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:12px;">
      Kaiser Permanente Woodland Hills Medical Center is a major hospital and medical campus serving Woodland Hills, Calabasas, West Hills, and surrounding communities. As part of the Kaiser Permanente integrated care system, the facility handles a wide range of inpatient services including surgery, cardiac care, and oncology. Families and patients here often need important documents notarized quickly without leaving the hospital. We provide mobile notary visits directly to the facility, helping you complete medical and legal paperwork so treatment, discharge, or family decisions are not delayed.
    </p>
    <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:12px;">
      As one of our Tier 1 (nearby) hospitals, Kaiser Woodland Hills is within our core service area, which means we can often respond quickly for same-day or next-day appointments.

    <div class="two-column-section">
      <div>
        <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:12px;">
          We coordinate with you by phone or text to confirm the patient's legal name, room number, and the documents that need notarization. When we arrive, we check in at the main entrance or security, follow Kaiser visitor procedures, and then meet you in the patient room or a designated family area.
        </p>
        <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:12px;">
          Our goal is to keep the visit calm, efficient, and respectful of doctors and nurses who may need access to the patient. If the patient is in a specialty unit, undergoing tests, or has visitor restrictions, let us know ahead of time so we can plan accordingly.
        </p>
        <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:12px;">
          Parking at Kaiser Woodland Hills typically involves a structure or surface lots near the main buildings. We factor this into our travel time and will provide an arrival window so you know when to expect us.

This service includes use of my laptop, portable printer, internet connection, and platform access.

    <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:12px;">
      To keep your visit smooth, please have:
    </p>

    <ul style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.8; margin-left:18px; margin-bottom:16px;">
      <li>A valid, government-issued photo ID for each signer (driver license, state ID, passport, or other accepted identification)</li>
      <li>All pages of the documents printed and ready, not just the signature page (unless using our laptop/printer service)</li>
      <li>Any required witnesses who are not named in the document and who meet the hospital's visitor rules</li>
    </ul>

    <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:12px;">
      If the patient has limited mobility or is unable to sign in their usual way, let us know beforehand so we can discuss acceptable options under California notary law.
    </p>

    <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:12px;">
      If ID is at home, we recommend having a family member bring it to the hospital before the appointment. In some cases, credible witnesses may be an option; we will discuss this with you in advance based on California law.

    <h2 style="font-size:22px; margin-bottom:10px;">Mobile notary FAQ for Kaiser Woodland Hills</h2>

    <div class="faq-block" style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6;">
      <p class="faq-question">Do I need to be a Kaiser member to use your notary service?</p>
      <p class="faq-answer">
        No. Our mobile notary service is independent from Kaiser Permanente. We come to the hospital to notarize documents for any patient or family member, regardless of their insurance or Kaiser membership status. You are hiring us directly as a mobile notary, not through the hospital.
      </p>

      <p class="faq-question">How quickly can you get to Kaiser Woodland Hills?</p>
      <p class="faq-answer">
        Kaiser Woodland Hills is within our Tier 1 service area. During business hours, we can often arrive within 1-2 hours for urgent needs, or schedule same-day when our calendar allows. For planned signings, next-day appointments are typically available. Travel time via the 101 depends on traffic, and we always confirm a specific arrival window when you book.
      </p>

      <p class="faq-question">Can you come to the Kaiser Woodland Hills campus even if the patient is in outpatient care?</p>
      <p class="faq-answer">
        Yes. While most hospital notarizations involve inpatients, we can also meet you at the Kaiser campus for outpatient situations if someone has limited mobility or is between appointments and cannot easily travel elsewhere. Let us know the building and department, and we will coordinate a convenient meeting spot.
      </p>

      <p class="faq-question">What if the patient is scheduled for surgery and needs documents signed beforehand?</p>
      <p class="faq-answer">
        Pre-surgery notarizations are common, especially for powers of attorney or healthcare directives. We recommend scheduling the signing at least a few hours before the procedure so there is no rush. The patient must be alert and not yet sedated when signing. Coordinate with the surgical team to confirm timing, and let us know the surgery schedule so we can arrive with enough buffer time.
      </p>

      <p class="faq-question">Where do I park when meeting a notary at Kaiser Woodland Hills?</p>
      <p class="faq-answer">
        If you are a visitor meeting us at the patient's room, the main parking structure near the hospital entrance is the easiest option. We handle our own parking and include that time in our arrival estimate. If you are waiting in a specific area or the patient's room is in a particular wing, let us know so we can text you when we are close and find you efficiently.
      </p>

      <p class="faq-question">Can Kaiser social workers or case managers be present during the signing?</p>
      <p class="faq-answer">
        Yes, hospital staff are welcome to be present if the patient or family prefers. However, whether they can serve as official witnesses depends on the document. Some forms prohibit employees of the treating facility from witnessing. We will clarify witness requirements when you describe your documents, and you can arrange for independent witnesses if needed.
