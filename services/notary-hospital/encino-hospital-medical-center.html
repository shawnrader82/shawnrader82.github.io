      Bedside notary visits in Encino
    </h2>
    <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:12px;">
      Encino Hospital Medical Center is a 150-bed nonprofit acute care community hospital located at 16237 Ventura Boulevard in Encino, and a member of the Prime Healthcare Foundation, a 501(c)(3) public charity. The hospital is staffed with 330 physicians and 420 professional support staff, providing 24/7 emergency services along with a wide range of specialized medical, surgical, and diagnostic services to the greater San Fernando Valley.
    </p>
    <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:12px;">
      Encino Hospital is known for its state-of-the-art geriatric services, including a Senior ER, Comprehensive Senior Care Program, Geriatric Inpatient Wing, and Psychiatric Inpatient Services. The hospital is accredited by The Joint Commission (TJC) and recognized by the American Heart Association for improving stroke treatment. Under CEO EM V. Garcia, Encino Hospital has received the Healthgrades Patient Safety Excellence Award and recognition from The Leapfrog Group.
    </p>
    <ul style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.8; margin-left:18px; margin-bottom:16px;">
      <li><strong>Address:</strong> 16237 Ventura Boulevard, Encino, CA 91436</li>
      <li><strong>Main phone:</strong> (818) 995&#8209;5000</li>
      <li><strong>Licensed beds:</strong> 148</li>
      <li><strong>Visiting hours:</strong> 9:00 AM &#8211; 9:00 PM daily (2 visitors per patient; children under 12 not permitted)</li>
      <li><strong>ICU/CCU visiting:</strong> 2 visitors at a time, 10 minutes every hour</li>
      <li><strong>Mental Health Unit:</strong> Mon&#8211;Fri 12&#8211;1 PM &amp; 5&#8211;7 PM; Weekends &amp; Holidays 3&#8211;7 PM</li>
      <li><strong>Emergency department:</strong> Open 24 hours</li>
      <li><strong>Parking:</strong> On-site hospital lot; street parking also available on Ventura Boulevard</li>
    </ul>
    <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:12px;">
      Because Encino is a straightforward drive south from our Granada Hills base via Balboa or White Oak, we treat this as a Tier 1 hospital. The smaller campus also means easier parking and faster check-in compared to some of the larger Valley hospitals.

    <div class="two-column-section">
      <div>
        <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:12px;">
          We coordinate with you by phone or text to confirm the patient&#8217;s legal name, room number, and the documents that need notarization. When we arrive, we check in at the front desk, follow hospital visitor procedures, and then meet you in the patient room or a designated family area.
        </p>
        <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:12px;">
          General visiting hours are 9:00 AM to 9:00 PM daily, with two visitors allowed per patient. If the patient is in the ICU or CCU, visits are limited to 2 visitors at a time for 10 minutes every hour. We schedule our arrival within these windows to ensure smooth access.
        </p>
        <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:12px;">
          Encino Hospital is a smaller, more manageable campus than the large medical centers in the Valley. This typically means shorter walks from the entrance to the patient room and a quieter environment for signing documents. We still keep the visit calm, efficient, and respectful of doctors and nurses who may need access to the patient.
        </p>
        <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:12px;">
          Parking along Ventura Boulevard and in the hospital lot is generally straightforward. We factor in a small buffer for access time and will text you when we arrive so you know we are close.

    <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:12px;">
      To keep your visit smooth, please have:
    </p>

    <ul style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.8; margin-left:18px; margin-bottom:16px;">
      <li>A valid, government-issued photo ID for each signer (driver license, state ID, passport, or other accepted identification)</li>
      <li>All pages of the documents printed and ready, not just the signature page (unless using our laptop/printer service)</li>
      <li>Any required witnesses who are not named in the document and who meet the hospital&#8217;s visitor rules</li>
    </ul>

    <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:12px;">
      If the patient has limited mobility or is unable to sign in their usual way, let us know beforehand so we can discuss acceptable options under California notary law.
    </p>

    <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:12px;">
      If ID is at home, we recommend having a family member bring it to the hospital before the appointment. In some cases, credible witnesses may be an option; we will discuss this with you in advance based on California law.

    <h2 style="font-size:22px; margin-bottom:10px;">Mobile notary FAQ for Encino Hospital Medical Center</h2>

    <div class="faq-block" style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6;">
      <p class="faq-question">Is Encino Hospital the same as Providence Cedars-Sinai Tarzana?</p>
      <p class="faq-answer">
        No. Encino Hospital Medical Center is a separate, smaller 148-bed community hospital on Ventura Boulevard in Encino, operated by the Prime Healthcare Foundation. Providence Cedars-Sinai Tarzana Medical Center is a larger facility about two miles west on Clark Street. We serve both hospitals at Tier 1 pricing. If you are unsure which hospital your family member is at, check their admission paperwork or ask the nurse&#8217;s station and let us know so we go to the right location.
      </p>

      <p class="faq-question">What are visiting hours at Encino Hospital?</p>
      <p class="faq-answer">
        General visiting hours are 9:00 AM to 9:00 PM daily, with two visitors allowed per patient. Children under 12 are not permitted to visit patients. Critical care areas (ICU, CCU) allow 2 visitors at a time for 10 minutes every hour. The Mental Health Unit has separate hours: Monday through Friday 12:00&#8211;1:00 PM and 5:00&#8211;7:00 PM, weekends and holidays 3:00&#8211;7:00 PM. We schedule our notary visit within these windows to ensure smooth access.
      </p>

      <p class="faq-question">How quickly can you get to Encino Hospital from Granada Hills?</p>
      <p class="faq-answer">
        Travel time is typically 20&#8211;30 minutes via Balboa Boulevard or White Oak Avenue heading south through the Valley. During business hours, we can often arrive within 1&#8211;2 hours for urgent requests, or schedule same-day when our calendar allows. We always confirm a specific arrival window when you book.
      </p>

      <p class="faq-question">Is Encino Hospital smaller than other Valley hospitals?</p>
      <p class="faq-answer">
        Yes. With 148 licensed beds, Encino Hospital is one of the smaller acute-care facilities in the San Fernando Valley. For notary visits, this is actually an advantage &#8212; the campus is compact, parking is easier, and we can usually get from the entrance to the patient room quickly. The quieter environment also makes for a calmer signing experience compared to larger, busier hospitals.
      </p>

      <p class="faq-question">Can you visit patients in the geriatric wing or psychiatric unit?</p>
      <p class="faq-answer">
        We can visit patients in the Geriatric Inpatient Wing as long as the patient is alert enough to understand and sign documents. The Psychiatric Inpatient Unit has separate visiting hours and access procedures; contact us with the patient&#8217;s unit information and we will coordinate with the facility to determine whether a notary visit is possible and when it can be scheduled.
      </p>

      <p class="faq-question">Can you also visit patients at nearby assisted living or skilled nursing facilities?</p>
      <p class="faq-answer">
        Yes. Encino and the surrounding Ventura Boulevard corridor have a number of assisted living communities and skilled nursing facilities. If a patient is discharged from Encino Hospital to a nearby facility, or if someone in a senior community needs notarization, we can visit them there as well at Tier 1 rates. Just let us know the facility name and address when you contact us.
      </p>

      <p class="faq-question">What if the patient is being transferred to a larger hospital?</p>
      <p class="faq-answer">
        If the patient is being transferred from Encino Hospital to a larger facility like Providence Cedars-Sinai Tarzana or Cedars-Sinai, it is usually best to complete the notarization before the transfer if time allows. Transfers can involve delays, new room assignments, and different visitor rules at the receiving hospital. If the transfer has already happened, contact us with the new hospital information and we will adjust accordingly.
