      Bedside notary visits in Encino
    </h2>
    <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:12px;">
      Encino Hospital Medical Center is a community hospital located at 16237 Ventura Boulevard in Encino. With approximately 148 licensed beds, the facility provides emergency services, surgical care, and a range of inpatient specialties. The hospital serves the Encino, Tarzana, Sherman Oaks, and Reseda communities along the Ventura Boulevard corridor in the central San Fernando Valley.
    </p>
    <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:12px;">
      Because Encino is a straightforward drive south from our Granada Hills base via Balboa or White Oak, we treat this as a Tier 1 hospital. The smaller campus also means easier parking and faster check-in compared to some of the larger Valley hospitals.

    <div class="two-column-section">
      <div>
        <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:12px;">
          We coordinate with you by phone or text to confirm the patient's legal name, room number, and the documents that need notarization. When we arrive, we check in at the front desk, follow hospital visitor procedures, and then meet you in the patient room or a designated family area.
        </p>
        <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:12px;">
          Encino Hospital is a smaller, more manageable campus than the large medical centers in the Valley. This typically means shorter walks from the entrance to the patient room and a quieter environment for signing documents. We still keep the visit calm, efficient, and respectful of doctors and nurses who may need access to the patient.
        </p>
        <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:12px;">
          Parking along Ventura Boulevard and in the hospital lot is generally straightforward. We factor in a small buffer for access time and will text you when we arrive so you know we are close.

    </p>

      <strong>Important:</strong> I am a commissioned notary public, not an attorney. I do not provide legal advice, recommend specific documents, or explain your legal rights.

For legal questions or to decide which documents are appropriate for your situation, please consult a licensed attorney.

    <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:12px;">
      To keep your visit smooth, please have:
    </p>

    <ul style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.8; margin-left:18px; margin-bottom:16px;">
      <li>A valid, government-issued photo ID for each signer (driver license, state ID, passport, or other accepted identification)</li>
      <li>All pages of the documents printed and ready, not just the signature page (unless using our laptop/printer service)</li>
      <li>Any required witnesses who are not named in the document and who meet the hospital's visitor rules</li>
    </ul>

    <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:12px;">
      If the patient has limited mobility or is unable to sign in their usual way, let us know beforehand so we can discuss acceptable options under California notary law.
    </p>

    <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:12px;">
      If ID is at home, we recommend having a family member bring it to the hospital before the appointment. In some cases, credible witnesses may be an option; we will discuss this with you in advance based on California law.

    <div class="service-detail-kicker">Frequently asked questions</div>
    <h2 style="font-size:22px; margin-bottom:10px;">Mobile notary FAQ for Encino Hospital Medical Center</h2>

    <div class="faq-block" style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6;">
      <p class="faq-question">Is Encino Hospital the same as Providence Cedars-Sinai Tarzana?</p>
      <p class="faq-answer">
        No. Encino Hospital Medical Center is a separate, smaller community hospital on Ventura Boulevard in Encino. Providence Cedars-Sinai Tarzana Medical Center is a larger facility about two miles west on Clark Street. We serve both hospitals at Tier 1 pricing. If you are unsure which hospital your family member is at, check their admission paperwork or ask the nurse's station and let us know so we go to the right location.
      </p>

      <p class="faq-question">How quickly can you get to Encino Hospital from Granada Hills?</p>
      <p class="faq-answer">
        Travel time is typically 20-30 minutes via Balboa Boulevard or White Oak Avenue heading south through the Valley. During business hours, we can often arrive within 1-2 hours for urgent requests, or schedule same-day when our calendar allows. We always confirm a specific arrival window when you book.
      </p>

      <p class="faq-question">Is Encino Hospital smaller than other Valley hospitals?</p>
      <p class="faq-answer">
        Yes. With approximately 148 beds, Encino Hospital is one of the smaller acute-care facilities in the San Fernando Valley. For notary visits, this is actually an advantage — the campus is compact, parking is easier, and we can usually get from the entrance to the patient room quickly. The quieter environment also makes for a calmer signing experience compared to larger, busier hospitals.
      </p>

      <p class="faq-question">Can you also visit patients at nearby assisted living or skilled nursing facilities?</p>
      <p class="faq-answer">
        Yes. Encino and the surrounding Ventura Boulevard corridor have a number of assisted living communities and skilled nursing facilities. If a patient is discharged from Encino Hospital to a nearby facility, or if someone in a senior community needs notarization, we can visit them there as well at Tier 1 rates. Just let us know the facility name and address when you contact us.
      </p>

      <p class="faq-question">What if the patient is being transferred to a larger hospital?</p>
      <p class="faq-answer">
        If the patient is being transferred from Encino Hospital to a larger facility like Providence Tarzana or Cedars-Sinai, it is usually best to complete the notarization before the transfer if time allows. Transfers can involve delays, new room assignments, and different visitor rules at the receiving hospital. If the transfer has already happened, contact us with the new hospital information and we will adjust accordingly.
      </p>

      <p class="faq-question">Do you serve Sherman Oaks, Reseda, and Tarzana from here?</p>
      <p class="faq-answer">
        Yes. Encino Hospital draws patients from across the central Ventura Boulevard corridor. We regularly serve patients and families in Encino, Sherman Oaks, Tarzana, Reseda, Lake Balboa, and Winnetka — all within our Tier 1 service area.
