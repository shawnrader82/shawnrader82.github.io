    <h2 style="font-size:24px; margin-bottom:10px;">
      Bedside notary visits at a major academic medical center
    </h2>
    <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:12px;">
      Keck Hospital of USC is a 401-bed acute care hospital located at 1500 San Pablo Street on the USC Health Sciences Campus in Boyle Heights, just a few miles east of downtown Los Angeles. As part of Keck Medicine of USC, the hospital provides advanced specialty care including transplant services, oncology, cardiology, neurosurgery, and complex surgical programs. Keck has been named among the best hospitals in the country by U.S. News &amp; World Report for eight consecutive years.
    </p>
    <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:12px;">
      The Health Sciences Campus also includes USC Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center and Hospital (1441 Eastlake Avenue), outpatient clinics, and the adjacent LA General Medical Center (the county hospital). Knowing which facility and building the patient is in is essential for a smooth visit.
    </p>
    <ul style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.8; margin-left:18px; margin-bottom:16px;">
      <li><strong>Address:</strong> 1500 San Pablo Street, Los Angeles, CA 90033</li>
      <li><strong>Main phone:</strong> (323) 442&#8209;8656</li>
      <li><strong>Appointments line:</strong> (800) USC&#8209;CARE (800&#8209;872&#8209;2273)</li>
      <li><strong>Visiting hours:</strong> 8:00 AM &#8211; 8:00 PM daily (after-hours visits may be approved by the unit&#8217;s lead RN)</li>
      <li><strong>Emergency department:</strong> Open 24 hours</li>
      <li><strong>Parking:</strong> South San Pablo Structure and Valley Lot; paid parking with campus shuttles available</li>
    </ul>
    <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:12px;">
      Because reaching Keck from Granada Hills involves traveling across the Valley and into East Los Angeles via the 5/10/101 corridors, we include this facility in our Tier 2 service area. We build additional travel and parking time into our scheduling and pricing so we can arrive prepared for campus navigation and visitor procedures.

    <div class="two-column-section">
      <div>
        <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:12px;">
          We coordinate with you by phone or text to confirm the patient&#8217;s legal name, unit, and room number, along with the documents that need notarization. When we arrive, we park in the South San Pablo Structure or Valley Lot, check in according to campus security and visitor procedures, and meet you in the patient room or a designated family area.
        </p>
        <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:12px;">
          The Keck campus includes multiple connected buildings, clinics, and patient towers, so precise location details are important. Let us know whether the patient is in Keck Hospital, USC Norris Cancer Hospital, or another nearby Keck facility so we can navigate directly to the correct entrance. We are used to working around teaching hospital schedules and coordinating with busy care teams.
        </p>
        <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:12px;">
          Parking structures and one-way streets around the campus can add a few extra minutes. We factor this into our arrival estimates and will text you when we are parked and walking in so you know we are close.

    <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:12px;">
      To keep your visit smooth, please have:
    </p>

    <ul style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.8; margin-left:18px; margin-bottom:16px;">
      <li>A valid, government-issued photo ID for each signer (driver license, state ID, passport, or other accepted identification)</li>
      <li>All pages of the documents printed and ready, not just the signature page (unless using our laptop/printer service)</li>
      <li>Any required witnesses who are not named in the document and who meet the hospital&#8217;s visitor rules</li>
    </ul>

    <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:12px;">
      If the patient has limited mobility or is unable to sign in their usual way, let us know beforehand so we can discuss acceptable options under California notary law.
    </p>

    <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:12px;">
      If ID is at home, we recommend having a family member bring it to the hospital before the appointment. In some cases, credible witnesses may be an option; we will discuss this with you in advance based on California law.

    <h2 style="font-size:22px; margin-bottom:10px;">Mobile notary FAQ for Keck Hospital of USC</h2>

    <div class="faq-block" style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6;">
      <p class="faq-question">Is Keck Hospital of USC the same as LA General Medical Center?</p>
      <p class="faq-answer">
        No. Keck Hospital of USC is a private 401-bed academic hospital operated by Keck Medicine of USC, located at 1500 San Pablo Street on the USC Health Sciences Campus in Boyle Heights. LA General Medical Center (formerly LAC+USC Medical Center) is the adjacent Los Angeles County public hospital. We can visit patients at either facility, but they have different campuses, entrances, and visitor procedures, so please confirm which hospital your loved one is at when you contact us.
      </p>

      <p class="faq-question">What are Keck Hospital&#8217;s visiting hours?</p>
      <p class="faq-answer">
        General visiting hours at Keck Hospital of USC are 8:00 AM to 8:00 PM daily. The emergency department entrance is open 24 hours. After-hours visits and overnight stays may be approved by the lead RN on the patient&#8217;s unit based on the patient&#8217;s medical condition and hospital operations. We coordinate our notary visit within allowed visiting windows or work with your family to confirm access.
      </p>

      <p class="faq-question">How long does it take you to get to Keck from Granada Hills?</p>
      <p class="faq-answer">
        Travel time typically ranges from 40&#8211;60 minutes depending on traffic on the 5, 10, and 101 freeways and local congestion around the campus. We schedule Keck visits as Tier 2 due to the distance and traffic, and we always check real-time conditions before confirming your arrival window. We will text you when we are parked and heading in.
      </p>

      <p class="faq-question">Can you visit patients in transplant, oncology, or other specialized units?</p>
      <p class="faq-answer">
        Yes, we can visit most inpatient units as long as hospital visitor policies allow and the patient is alert enough to understand and sign documents. At a specialized center like Keck, many patients are in transplant, oncology, or intensive care units. We coordinate timing with family members and, when appropriate, nursing staff to avoid conflicts with procedures or rounds.
      </p>

      <p class="faq-question">Can you also visit patients at USC Norris Cancer Hospital?</p>
      <p class="faq-answer">
        Yes. USC Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center and Hospital is located at 1441 Eastlake Avenue on the same Health Sciences Campus. If the patient is at Norris rather than Keck Hospital, let us know so we can navigate to the correct building. The same Tier 2 pricing applies.
      </p>

      <p class="faq-question">Can you coordinate with my attorney or care team for documents?</p>
      <p class="faq-answer">
        Absolutely. Many Keck patients work with attorneys, financial advisors, or care coordinators who prepare documents in advance. Your attorney can email documents to you or directly to us for printing using our laptop and portable printer service. We do not provide legal advice, but we ensure the paperwork your professional team prepares is printed, organized, and ready to sign and notarize at the bedside.
      </p>

      <p class="faq-question">Do you also serve nearby areas like East LA, Montebello, and Alhambra?</p>
      <p class="faq-answer">
        Yes. In addition to Keck Hospital itself, we serve homes, senior communities, and medical offices in Boyle Heights, East Los Angeles, Montebello, Alhambra, Monterey Park, and surrounding neighborhoods. These visits are generally treated as Tier 2 due to the distance from our Granada Hills base.
      </p>

      <p class="faq-question">What if the patient is transferred between Keck and LA General?</p>
      <p class="faq-answer">
        Transfers between Keck Hospital and LA General Medical Center do happen, especially for certain types of care. If a transfer is planned, it is often easier to complete notarization before the move if time allows. If the patient has already been transferred, contact us with the new hospital and unit information and we will adjust our plan accordingly.
