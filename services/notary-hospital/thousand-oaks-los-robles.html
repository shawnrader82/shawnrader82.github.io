      Bedside notary visits in Thousand Oaks
    </h2>
    <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:12px;">
      Los Robles Regional Medical Center is a full-service hospital located at 215 West Janss Road in Thousand Oaks, serving the Conejo Valley including Thousand Oaks, Westlake Village, Newbury Park, Agoura Hills, and Oak Park. The facility is part of the HCA Healthcare system and offers emergency services, a Level II trauma center, cardiac care, orthopedics, and a comprehensive stroke program. For families facing a hospital stay in the Conejo Valley, we provide mobile notary visits directly to the facility.
    </p>
    <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:12px;">
      Los Robles is part of our Tier 2 service area due to the longer drive from our Granada Hills base via the 101 freeway. We build additional travel time into scheduling and pricing to ensure we arrive on time and prepared.

    <div class="service-detail-kicker">How our visits at Los Robles work</div>
    <h2 style="font-size:22px; margin-bottom:10px;">What to expect when you book</h2>

    <div class="two-column-section">
      <div>
        <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:12px;">
          We coordinate with you by phone or text to confirm the patient's legal name, room number, and the documents that need notarization. When we arrive, we check in at the main entrance or security, follow hospital visitor procedures, and then meet you in the patient room or a designated family area.
        </p>
        <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:12px;">
          Our goal is to keep the visit calm, efficient, and respectful of doctors and nurses who may need access to the patient. If the patient is in the ICU, trauma unit, or another restricted area, let us know ahead of time so we can plan around visiting hours and access rules.
        </p>
        <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:12px;">
          Travel to Thousand Oaks via the 101 varies significantly with traffic. The Calabasas-to-Thousand Oaks stretch can be slow during commute hours. We schedule a specific arrival window that accounts for current conditions and will keep you updated if anything changes en route.

    <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:12px;">
      Many families call from Los Robles when time and mobility are limited. Typical documents include:
    </p>

    <ul style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.8; margin-left:18px; margin-bottom:16px;">
      <li>Advance healthcare directives and living wills</li>
      <li>Medical and durable powers of attorney</li>
      <li>HIPAA authorization and medical records release forms</li>
      <li>Wills, trust documents, and related estate forms</li>
      <li>Financial powers of attorney and insurance or benefit forms that require notarization</li>
      <li>Facility admission, transfer, or discharge paperwork</li>
    </ul>

    <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:12px;">
      If you are not sure whether your form needs to be notarized, you can text us a clear photo in advance so we can review the notary section.

    <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:12px;">
      If you need a power of attorney, healthcare directive, or other form but do not have it ready, you can use my equipment and Rocket Lawyer access to create the document during our appointment. This service includes use of my laptop, portable printer, internet connection, and platform access. You choose which documents to create; I provide the hardware and administrative help to get the paperwork ready.

      <strong>Important:</strong> I am a commissioned notary public, not an attorney. I do not provide legal advice, recommend specific documents, or explain your legal rights. Any help I provide with Rocket Lawyer or similar services is strictly administrative - using my laptop, printer, internet connection, and platform access to help you generate, print, and organize the forms you choose so they are ready to sign and notarize. For legal questions or to decide which documents are appropriate for your situation, please consult a licensed attorney.

    <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:12px;">
      To keep your visit smooth, please have:
    </p>

    <ul style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.8; margin-left:18px; margin-bottom:16px;">
      <li>A valid, government-issued photo ID for each signer (driver license, state ID, passport, or other accepted identification)</li>
      <li>All pages of the documents printed and ready, not just the signature page (unless using our laptop/printer service)</li>
      <li>Any required witnesses who are not named in the document and who meet the hospital's visitor rules</li>
    </ul>

    <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:12px;">
      If the patient has limited mobility or is unable to sign in their usual way, let us know beforehand so we can discuss acceptable options under California notary law.
    </p>

    <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:12px;">
      If ID is at home, we recommend having a family member bring it to the hospital before the appointment. In some cases, credible witnesses may be an option; we will discuss this with you in advance based on California law.

    <h2 style="font-size:22px; margin-bottom:10px;">Mobile notary FAQ for Los Robles Regional Medical Center</h2>

    <div class="faq-block" style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6;">
      <p class="faq-question">How long does it take you to get to Los Robles from Granada Hills?</p>
      <p class="faq-answer">
        Travel to Thousand Oaks via the 101 freeway typically takes 40-60 minutes in normal traffic. During morning or evening rush hour, the drive through Calabasas and Agoura Hills can take longer. We always check real-time traffic before confirming your arrival window and will notify you if significant delays are expected.
      </p>

      <p class="faq-question">Can you visit patients in the Los Robles trauma center?</p>
      <p class="faq-answer">
        Yes, Los Robles has a Level II trauma center and we can visit trauma patients as long as the hospital permits visitors and the patient is conscious, alert, and able to understand and sign documents. Trauma situations are unpredictable, so we recommend confirming visitor access with the nursing staff before we arrive and having a backup time in mind in case the patient's condition changes.
      </p>

      <p class="faq-question">Do you also serve Westlake Village, Newbury Park, and Agoura Hills?</p>
      <p class="faq-answer">
        Yes. While Los Robles is located in Thousand Oaks, we serve patients and families throughout the Conejo Valley, including Westlake Village, Newbury Park, Agoura Hills, and Oak Park. If the patient is discharged to a home, rehab facility, or assisted living community in any of these areas, we can arrange a follow-up visit there as well at the same Tier 2 rate.
      </p>

      <p class="faq-question">What if I need multiple family members to sign different documents?</p>
      <p class="faq-answer">
        We can notarize documents for multiple signers during a single hospital visit. Each person who signs will need their own valid government-issued photo ID and must personally appear before the notary. If different family members need to sign different documents (for example, one person signing a power of attorney and another signing a healthcare directive), we can handle all of it in one trip as long as everyone is present and has their ID.
      </p>

      <p class="faq-question">Is Los Robles in Los Angeles County or Ventura County?</p>
      <p class="faq-answer">
        Los Robles Regional Medical Center is in Thousand Oaks, which is in Ventura County. Our California notary commission covers the entire state, so county lines do not affect whether we can notarize your documents. The Tier 2 pricing reflects the additional travel distance from our LA County base, not a jurisdictional difference.
      </p>

      <p class="faq-question">Can you coordinate with my attorney who is sending documents from their office?</p>
      <p class="faq-answer">
        Absolutely. If your attorney is emailing or faxing documents to you at the hospital and you do not have a way to print them, our laptop and portable printer service solves that problem. Your attorney can send the documents to your email, and we can download, review the notary sections, print, and have them ready for signing when we arrive. We do this regularly for estate planning attorneys and elder law firms coordinating hospital signings remotely.
