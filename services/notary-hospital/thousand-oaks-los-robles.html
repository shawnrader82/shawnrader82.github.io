      Bedside notary visits in Thousand Oaks
    </h2>
    <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:12px;">
      Los Robles Regional Medical Center is a 312-bed general acute care hospital located at 215 West Janss Road in Thousand Oaks, CA 91360. Part of the HCA Healthcare system and established in 1968, Los Robles is the community&#8217;s most trusted health resource and a regional destination for care, with nearly 600 physicians on staff representing more than 50 medical and dental specialties. The hospital serves a wide area including Thousand Oaks, Westlake Village, Newbury Park, Agoura Hills, Oak Park, and the broader Conejo Valley.
    </p>
    <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:12px;">
      Los Robles holds several unique designations. It operates the <strong>only Level II Trauma Center in eastern Ventura County</strong> and the <strong>only emergency room in both Los Angeles and Ventura counties with an EDAP rating</strong> (Emergency Department Approved for Pediatrics). It is also certified by both counties as a <strong>STEMI-designated Heart Attack Center</strong> for rapid heart attack response and is a <strong>Comprehensive Stroke Center</strong>. The hospital&#8217;s heliport was recently upgraded to accommodate Ventura County and Los Angeles County Firehawk helicopters to better serve trauma patients. Los Robles is also a leader in clinical trials and welcomed its first Graduate Medical Education class in 2021.

      Los Robles is part of our Tier 2 service area due to the longer drive from our Granada Hills base via the 101 freeway. We build additional travel time into scheduling and pricing to ensure we arrive on time and prepared.

    <div class="two-column-section">
      <div>
        <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:12px;">
          We coordinate with you by phone or text to confirm the patient&#8217;s legal name, room number, and the documents that need notarization. When we arrive, we check in at the main entrance or security, follow hospital visitor procedures, and then meet you in the patient room or a designated family area.
        </p>
        <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:12px;">
          Visiting hours at Los Robles are <strong>Monday through Friday, 8:00 AM to 8:00 PM</strong>. Extended visiting hours may apply for laboring mothers in the labor and delivery unit, hospice or palliative care patients, pediatric and NICU patients, and special needs patients. Visitor limits vary by unit: up to four visitors in general rooms; two visitors in the CCU and ICU; one visitor in the emergency department and outpatient surgical unit (minor patients may have both parents). We schedule our notary visit within these hours and coordinate with you on any unit-specific restrictions.
        </p>
        <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:12px;">
          Our goal is to keep the visit calm, efficient, and respectful of doctors and nurses who may need access to the patient. If the patient is in the ICU, trauma unit, CCU, or another restricted area, let us know ahead of time so we can plan around access rules and visitor limits.
        </p>
        <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:12px;">
          Travel to Thousand Oaks via the 101 varies significantly with traffic. The Calabasas-to-Thousand Oaks stretch can be slow during commute hours. We schedule a specific arrival window that accounts for current conditions and will keep you updated if anything changes en route.

      To keep your visit smooth, please have:
    </p>

    <ul style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.8; margin-left:18px; margin-bottom:16px;">
      <li>A valid, government-issued photo ID for each signer (driver license, state ID, passport, or other accepted identification)</li>
      <li>All pages of the documents printed and ready, not just the signature page (unless using our laptop/printer service)</li>
      <li>Any required witnesses who are not named in the document and who meet the hospital&#8217;s visitor rules</li>
    </ul>

    <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:12px;">
      If the patient has limited mobility or is unable to sign in their usual way, let us know beforehand so we can discuss acceptable options under California notary law.
    </p>

    <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:12px;">
      If ID is at home, we recommend having a family member bring it to the hospital before the appointment. In some cases, credible witnesses may be an option; we will discuss this with you in advance based on California law.

      <p class="faq-question">How long does it take you to get to Los Robles from Granada Hills?</p>
      <p class="faq-answer">
        Travel to Thousand Oaks via the 101 freeway typically takes 40&#8211;60 minutes in normal traffic. During morning or evening rush hour, the drive through Calabasas and Agoura Hills can take longer. We always check real-time traffic before confirming your arrival window and will notify you if significant delays are expected.
      </p>

      <p class="faq-question">What are visiting hours at Los Robles Regional Medical Center?</p>
      <p class="faq-answer">
        Visiting hours are <strong>Monday through Friday, 8:00 AM to 8:00 PM</strong>. Extended visiting hours may apply for laboring mothers in the labor and delivery unit, hospice or palliative care patients, pediatric and NICU patients, and special needs patients. Visitor limits vary by unit: up to four visitors in general rooms; two visitors in the CCU and ICU; one visitor in the emergency department and outpatient surgical unit (minor patients may have both parents). We schedule our notary visit within these hours and recommend confirming any unit-specific policies when you book.
      </p>

      <p class="faq-question">Can you visit patients in the Los Robles trauma center?</p>
      <p class="faq-answer">
        Yes. Los Robles operates the only Level II Trauma Center in eastern Ventura County, with an upgraded heliport that accommodates county Firehawk helicopters. We can visit trauma patients as long as the hospital permits visitors and the patient is conscious, alert, and able to understand and sign documents. ICU and trauma areas are limited to two visitors per patient. Trauma situations are unpredictable, so we recommend confirming visitor access with the nursing staff before we arrive and having a backup time in mind in case the patient&#8217;s condition changes.

      <p class="faq-question">Do you also serve Westlake Village, Newbury Park, and Agoura Hills?</p>
      <p class="faq-answer">
        Yes. While Los Robles is located in Thousand Oaks, we serve patients and families throughout the Conejo Valley, including Westlake Village, Newbury Park, Agoura Hills, and Oak Park. If the patient is discharged to a home, rehab facility, or assisted living community in any of these areas, we can arrange a follow-up visit there as well at the same Tier 2 rate.
      </p>

      <p class="faq-question">What if I need multiple family members to sign different documents?</p>
      <p class="faq-answer">
        We can notarize documents for multiple signers during a single hospital visit. Each person who signs will need their own valid government-issued photo ID and must personally appear before the notary. If different family members need to sign different documents (for example, one person signing a power of attorney and another signing a healthcare directive), we can handle all of it in one trip as long as everyone is present and has their ID.
      </p>

      <p class="faq-question">Is Los Robles in Los Angeles County or Ventura County?</p>
      <p class="faq-answer">
        Los Robles Regional Medical Center is in Thousand Oaks, which is in Ventura County. Our California notary commission covers the entire state, so county lines do not affect whether we can notarize your documents. The Tier 2 pricing reflects the additional travel distance from our LA County base, not a jurisdictional difference.
      </p>

      <p class="faq-question">Can you coordinate with my attorney who is sending documents from their office?</p>
      <p class="faq-answer">
        Absolutely. If your attorney is emailing or faxing documents to you at the hospital and you do not have a way to print them, our laptop and portable printer service solves that problem. Your attorney can send the documents to your email, and we can download, review the notary sections, print, and have them ready for signing when we arrive. We do this regularly for estate planning attorneys and elder law firms coordinating hospital signings remotely.
