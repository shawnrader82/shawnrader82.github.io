      Bedside notary visits in Simi Valley
    </h2>
    <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:12px;">
      Adventist Health Simi Valley is a 136-bed general acute care hospital located at 2975 North Sycamore Drive in Simi Valley, CA 93065. Established in 1965, it is part of the Adventist Health system and is the primary hospital serving communities in and around Simi Valley, Moorpark, and eastern Ventura County. The facility features a Basic Emergency Room, ICU/critical care services, cardiac catheterization and cardiac surgery, diagnostic imaging and mammography, outpatient infusion and chemotherapy, and a full surgical department.
    </p>
    <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:12px;">
      Additional services available through the Adventist Health Simi Valley campus and physician network include bariatric and weight loss care, cancer care, a child development center, digestive health, heart care, occupational therapy, physical therapy, and speech therapy. For families dealing with a hospital stay in Simi Valley, we provide mobile notary visits directly to the facility so critical documents can be signed and notarized without leaving the hospital.
    </p>
    <ul style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.8; margin-left:18px; margin-bottom:16px;">

      Because Simi Valley is farther from our Granada Hills base, this location is part of our Tier 2 service area with additional travel time built into scheduling and pricing. We reach Simi Valley via the 118 freeway, and travel time varies depending on traffic conditions.

      <div>
        <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:12px;">
          We coordinate with you by phone or text to confirm the patient&#8217;s legal name, room number, and the documents that need notarization. When we arrive, we check in at the main entrance, obtain a visitor badge, and follow hospital visitor procedures before meeting you in the patient room or a designated family area.
        </p>
        <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:12px;">
          Adventist Health hospitals typically allow visitors from 12:00 PM to 9:00 PM daily. All visitors must check in at the front desk and obtain a badge that remains visible at all times. ICU visitors are requested to wait in the assigned ICU waiting room until cleared by nursing staff. Children under 12 should be accompanied by an adult other than the patient. We schedule our notary visit to fall within visiting hours, and we recommend confirming current policies with the hospital when you book.
        </p>
        <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:12px;">
          Travel to Simi Valley can vary with freeway traffic on the 118. We schedule a specific arrival window that accounts for driving and parking time so you know when to expect us. We will text you when we arrive on campus.

      To keep your visit smooth, please have:
    </p>

    <ul style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.8; margin-left:18px; margin-bottom:16px;">
      <li>A valid, government-issued photo ID for each signer (driver license, state ID, passport, or other accepted identification)</li>

      If the patient has limited mobility or is unable to sign in their usual way, let us know beforehand so we can discuss acceptable options under California notary law.
    </p>

    <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:12px;">
      If ID is at home, we recommend having a family member bring it to the hospital before the appointment. In some cases, credible witnesses may be an option; we will discuss this with you in advance based on California law.

    <h2 style="font-size:22px; margin-bottom:10px;">Mobile notary FAQ for Adventist Health Simi Valley</h2>

    <div class="faq-block" style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6;">
      <p class="faq-question">Why is the price higher for Adventist Health Simi Valley than some other hospitals?</p>
      <p class="faq-answer">
        Simi Valley is outside our immediate service area in the San Fernando Valley, so the drive via the 118 freeway adds significant travel time, especially during peak hours. Our Tier 2 pricing reflects that additional round-trip travel. You will always know the total cost before we schedule the appointment, with no surprise fees.
      </p>

      <p class="faq-question">How long does it take you to get to Simi Valley from Granada Hills?</p>
      <p class="faq-answer">
        Travel time on the 118 typically ranges from 30&#8211;50 minutes in light traffic, but can exceed an hour during rush hour or if there is an incident in the pass. We check real-time traffic before confirming your arrival window and will notify you of any significant delays so you can plan around the patient&#8217;s care schedule.
      </p>

      <p class="faq-question">What are visiting hours at Adventist Health Simi Valley?</p>
      <p class="faq-answer">
        Adventist Health hospitals typically allow visitors from 12:00 PM to 9:00 PM daily. All visitors must check in at the front desk at the main entrance and obtain a visitor badge that remains visible at all times. ICU visitors are requested to wait in the assigned ICU waiting room until cleared by staff. Children under 12 should be accompanied by an adult other than the patient. Visitors who are ill or have been recently exposed to a communicable disease are not permitted. We schedule our notary visit to fall within these visiting hours, and we recommend confirming current policies with the hospital when you book.
      </p>

      <p class="faq-question">Are there any mobile notaries closer to Simi Valley?</p>
      <p class="faq-answer">
        There may be notaries based in Simi Valley or Moorpark, but many families choose us because we specialize in hospital and bedside notarizations, bring a laptop and portable printer for on-site document generation, and have experience working around medical staff and equipment. If same-day urgency and proximity are your top priorities, we are happy to help you evaluate the best option for your situation.
      </p>

      <p class="faq-question">Can you also visit patients at skilled nursing or rehab facilities in Simi Valley?</p>
      <p class="faq-answer">
        Yes. If the patient is at a skilled nursing facility, assisted living community, or rehab center in Simi Valley or Moorpark, we can arrange a visit there as well. The same Tier 2 pricing applies. Let us know the facility name and address when you contact us, and we will confirm availability and timing.
      </p>

      <p class="faq-question">What if the patient is being transferred from Adventist Health Simi Valley to another hospital?</p>
      <p class="faq-answer">
        Inter-facility transfers often create urgency around powers of attorney or healthcare directives. If the patient is being transferred to a hospital closer to our base (like Providence Holy Cross or Northridge Hospital), it may make sense to schedule the notarization at the receiving hospital instead. We can help you figure out the most practical timing and location based on the transfer schedule.
      </p>

      <p class="faq-question">Do you offer after-hours or weekend visits to Adventist Health Simi Valley?</p>
      <p class="faq-answer">
        We can accommodate evening and weekend appointments for hospital visits when the situation is urgent. Because the drive to Simi Valley is longer, after-hours visits may carry an additional surcharge on top of the Tier 2 base rate. We will quote you the full cost upfront when you describe your timing needs so there are no surprises.
