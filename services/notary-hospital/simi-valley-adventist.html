      Bedside notary visits in Simi Valley
    </h2>
    <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:12px;">
      Adventist Health Simi Valley is a community hospital located at 2975 North Sycamore Drive in Simi Valley, serving patients throughout Simi Valley, Moorpark, and eastern Ventura County. The facility offers emergency services, surgical care, orthopedics, cardiac rehabilitation, and a range of inpatient units. For families dealing with a hospital stay in Simi Valley, we provide mobile notary visits directly to the facility so critical documents can be signed and notarized without leaving the hospital.
    </p>
    <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:12px;">
      Because Simi Valley is farther from our Granada Hills base, this location is part of our Tier 2 service area with additional travel time built into scheduling and pricing. We reach Simi Valley via the 118 freeway, and travel time varies depending on traffic conditions.

    <div class="two-column-section">
      <div>
        <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:12px;">
          We coordinate with you by phone or text to confirm the patient's legal name, room number, and the documents that need notarization. When we arrive, we check in at the main entrance or security, follow hospital visitor procedures, and then meet you in the patient room or a designated family area.
        </p>
        <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:12px;">
          Our goal is to keep the visit calm, efficient, and respectful of doctors and nurses who may need access to the patient. If the patient is in the ICU, emergency department, or another restricted unit, let us know ahead of time so we can plan around visiting hours and access rules.
        </p>
        <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:12px;">
          Travel to Simi Valley can vary with freeway traffic on the 118. We schedule a specific arrival window that accounts for driving and parking time so you know when to expect us.

    <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:12px;">
      If you need a power of attorney, healthcare directive, or other form but do not have it ready, you can use my equipment and Rocket Lawyer access to create the document during our appointment. This service includes use of my laptop, portable printer, internet connection, and platform access.

      <strong>Important:</strong> I am a commissioned notary public, not an attorney. I do not provide legal advice, recommend specific documents, or explain your legal rights. Any help I provide with Rocket Lawyer or similar services is strictly administrative - using my laptop, printer, internet connection, and platform access to help you generate, print, and organize the forms you choose so they are ready to sign and notarize. For legal questions or to decide which documents are appropriate for your situation, please consult a licensed attorney.

    <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:12px;">
      To keep your visit smooth, please have:
    </p>

    <ul style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.8; margin-left:18px; margin-bottom:16px;">
      <li>A valid, government-issued photo ID for each signer (driver license, state ID, passport, or other accepted identification)</li>
      <li>All pages of the documents printed and ready, not just the signature page (unless using our laptop/printer service)</li>
      <li>Any required witnesses who are not named in the document and who meet the hospital's visitor rules</li>
    </ul>

    <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:12px;">
      If the patient has limited mobility or is unable to sign in their usual way, let us know beforehand so we can discuss acceptable options under California notary law.
    </p>

    <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:12px;">
      If ID is at home, we recommend having a family member bring it to the hospital before the appointment. In some cases, credible witnesses may be an option; we will discuss this with you in advance based on California law.

    <h2 style="font-size:22px; margin-bottom:10px;">Mobile notary FAQ for Adventist Health Simi Valley</h2>

    <div class="faq-block" style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6;">
      <p class="faq-question">Why is the price higher for Adventist Health Simi Valley than some other hospitals?</p>
      <p class="faq-answer">
        Simi Valley is outside our immediate service area in the San Fernando Valley, so the drive via the 118 freeway adds significant travel time, especially during peak hours. Our Tier 2 pricing reflects that additional round-trip travel. You will always know the total cost before we schedule the appointment, with no surprise fees.
      </p>

      <p class="faq-question">How long does it take you to get to Simi Valley from Granada Hills?</p>
      <p class="faq-answer">
        Travel time on the 118 typically ranges from 30-50 minutes in light traffic, but can exceed an hour during rush hour or if there is an incident in the pass. We check real-time traffic before confirming your arrival window and will notify you of any significant delays so you can plan around the patient's care schedule.
      </p>

      <p class="faq-question">Are there any mobile notaries closer to Simi Valley?</p>
      <p class="faq-answer">
        There may be notaries based in Simi Valley or Moorpark, but many families choose us because we specialize in hospital and bedside notarizations, bring a laptop and portable printer for on-site document generation, and have experience working around medical staff and equipment. If same-day urgency and proximity are your top priorities, we are happy to help you evaluate the best option for your situation.
      </p>

      <p class="faq-question">Can you also visit patients at skilled nursing or rehab facilities in Simi Valley?</p>
      <p class="faq-answer">
        Yes. If the patient is at a skilled nursing facility, assisted living community, or rehab center in Simi Valley or Moorpark, we can arrange a visit there as well. The same Tier 2 pricing applies. Let us know the facility name and address when you contact us, and we will confirm availability and timing.
      </p>

      <p class="faq-question">What if the patient is being transferred from Adventist Health Simi Valley to another hospital?</p>
      <p class="faq-answer">
        Inter-facility transfers often create urgency around powers of attorney or healthcare directives. If the patient is being transferred to a hospital closer to our base (like Providence Holy Cross or Northridge Hospital), it may make sense to schedule the notarization at the receiving hospital instead. We can help you figure out the most practical timing and location based on the transfer schedule.
      </p>

      <p class="faq-question">Do you offer after-hours or weekend visits to Adventist Health Simi Valley?</p>
      <p class="faq-answer">
        We can accommodate evening and weekend appointments for hospital visits when the situation is urgent. Because the drive to Simi Valley is longer, after-hours visits may carry an additional surcharge on top of the Tier 2 base rate. We will quote you the full cost upfront when you describe your timing needs so there are no surprises.
