        <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:12px;">
          We coordinate with you by phone or text to confirm the patient&#8217;s legal name, room number, and the documents that need notarization. When we arrive, we check in at the front desk or security, follow hospital visitor procedures, and then meet you in the patient room or a designated family area.
        </p>
        <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:12px;">
          Providence Holy Cross welcomes visitors any time of the day, seven days a week. Nighttime quiet hours run from 10:00 PM to 8:00 AM; visitors who remain during quiet time are encouraged to stay in the patient&#8217;s room. ICU visiting hours are 8:30 AM to 10:00 PM, with a quiet period from 7:00 to 8:30 PM and one designated visitor allowed to stay after hours. We schedule our notary visit to work within whatever window is best for the patient.
        </p>
        <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:12px;">
          Our goal is to keep the visit calm, efficient, and respectful of doctors and nurses who may need access to the patient. If the patient is in the ICU, trauma unit, or has visitor restrictions, let us know ahead of time so we can plan accordingly.
        </p>
        <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:12px;">
          Providence Holy Cross has a multi-level parking structure near the main entrance off Rinaldi Street. We build extra time into the visit for parking and walking to your room, and we will text you when we are on our way in.

      To keep your visit smooth, please have:
    </p>

    <ul style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.8; margin-left:18px; margin-bottom:16px;">
      <li>A valid, government-issued photo ID for each signer (driver license, state ID, passport, or other accepted identification)</li>

      If the patient has limited mobility or is unable to sign in their usual way, let us know beforehand so we can discuss acceptable options under California notary law.
    </p>

    <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:12px;">
      If ID is at home, we recommend having a family member bring it to the hospital before the appointment. In some cases, credible witnesses may be an option; we will discuss this with you in advance based on California law.

    <div class="faq-block" style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6;">
      <p class="faq-question">How quickly can you get to Providence Holy Cross Medical Center?</p>
      <p class="faq-answer">
        Because Holy Cross is one of our closest hospitals &#8212; just minutes from our Granada Hills base &#8212; we can often arrive within 1&#8211;2 hours for urgent requests during business hours, or schedule a same-day appointment when our calendar allows. For non-urgent needs, we typically offer next-day availability. Traffic on the 118 and 405 can affect timing, so we always confirm a specific arrival window when you book.
      </p>

      <p class="faq-question">What are visiting hours at Providence Holy Cross?</p>
      <p class="faq-answer">
        Providence Holy Cross welcomes visitors any time of the day, seven days a week. Nighttime quiet hours run from 10:00 PM to 8:00 AM; visitors who remain during quiet time are encouraged to stay in the patient&#8217;s room. ICU visiting hours are 8:30 AM to 10:00 PM, with a quiet period from 7:00 to 8:30 PM. After ICU hours, one designated visitor may stay in the patient&#8217;s room. Children under 12 are discouraged from visiting the ICU. This open visiting policy gives us flexibility to schedule notary visits at times that work best for the patient.
      </p>

      <p class="faq-question">Can you notarize in the ICU or trauma unit at Holy Cross?</p>
      <p class="faq-answer">
        Yes, we can visit patients in the ICU, trauma unit, or other restricted areas as long as the hospital allows visitors and the patient is alert enough to understand and sign the documents. ICU visiting hours are 8:30 AM to 10:00 PM. We recommend coordinating with the nursing staff to find a time when the patient is awake and not scheduled for procedures. Some units have specific visiting hours or require staff approval before we can enter.
      </p>

      <p class="faq-question">Where do you park when visiting Providence Holy Cross?</p>
      <p class="faq-answer">
        Holy Cross has a multi-level parking structure near the main entrance off Rinaldi Street. We factor parking and walking time into our arrival estimate. If you are in a unit far from the main entrance, let us know so we can plan accordingly and text you when we are close.
      </p>

      <p class="faq-question">What if the patient cannot hold a pen or sign their name?</p>
      <p class="faq-answer">
        California law allows for signature by mark (such as an &#8220;X&#8221;) if the signer cannot write their full name, as long as certain witness requirements are met. In some cases, a signature by proxy may be possible, where another person signs on behalf of the signer at their direction. We will discuss the options with you before the appointment based on the patient&#8217;s condition and the type of document.
      </p>

      <p class="faq-question">Can hospital social workers or nurses witness the documents?</p>
      <p class="faq-answer">
        It depends on the document. Some forms allow hospital staff to serve as witnesses, while others require independent witnesses who are not employees of the facility or named in the document. Healthcare directives in California have specific witness rules. We will let you know what is required when you describe your documents, and you can arrange for family members or friends to be present if independent witnesses are needed.
      </p>

      <p class="faq-question">What if the patient is discharged before you arrive?</p>
      <p class="faq-answer">
        Hospital situations change quickly. If the patient is discharged or moved before our scheduled arrival, contact us as soon as possible. We can often redirect to a home, rehab facility, or other location. If we are already en route and the appointment cannot proceed, we will work with you on rescheduling or adjusting the visit.
