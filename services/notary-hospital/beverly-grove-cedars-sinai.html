    <h2 style="font-size:24px; margin-bottom:10px;">
      Bedside notary visits at a major Los Angeles hospital
    </h2>
    <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:12px;">
      Cedars-Sinai Medical Center is one of the best-known hospitals in Los Angeles, located along Beverly Boulevard and San Vicente Boulevard in the Beverly Grove neighborhood. The campus includes a large main hospital, specialty towers, and outpatient centers serving patients from across Southern California and beyond. Cedars is nationally recognized for cardiology, cancer care, transplant programs, neurology, and many other specialties.
    </p>
    <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:12px;">
      Because Cedars-Sinai is in central Los Angeles and traffic to Beverly Grove can be unpredictable, this facility is part of our Tier 2 service area. We factor additional travel and parking time into scheduling and pricing so we can arrive prepared and on time.

    <div class="two-column-section">
      <div>
        <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:12px;">
          We coordinate with you by phone or text to confirm the patient's legal name, room number, and the documents that need notarization. Because the Cedars campus is large and multi-building, we will also ask which tower or wing the patient is in so we can find you efficiently once we arrive.
        </p>
        <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:12px;">
          When we get to Cedars, we check in at the appropriate entrance, follow hospital visitor procedures, and then meet you in the patient room or a quiet family area. Our goal is to keep the visit calm, efficient, and respectful of the medical team, especially in higher-acuity units.
        </p>
        <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:12px;">
          Parking garages and valet areas at Cedars can be busy, particularly on weekdays. We include time for parking and walking the campus in our arrival estimate and will text you when we are on-site so you know we are close.

    </p>

    <ul style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.8; margin-left:18px; margin-bottom:16px;">

    <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:12px;">

      If you need a power of attorney, healthcare directive, or other form but do not have it ready, you can use my equipment and Rocket Lawyer access to create the document during our appointment. This service includes use of my laptop, portable printer, internet connection, and platform access.

      <strong>Important:</strong> I am a commissioned notary public, not an attorney. I do not provide legal advice, recommend specific documents, or explain your legal rights. Any help I provide with Rocket Lawyer or similar services is strictly administrative - using my laptop, printer, internet connection, and platform access to help you generate, print, and organize the forms you choose so they are ready to sign and notarize. For legal questions or to decide which documents are appropriate for your situation, please consult a licensed attorney.

    <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:12px;">
      To keep your visit smooth, please have:
    </p>

    <ul style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.8; margin-left:18px; margin-bottom:16px;">
      <li>A valid, government-issued photo ID for each signer (driver license, state ID, passport, or other accepted identification)</li>
      <li>All pages of the documents printed and ready, not just the signature page (unless using our laptop/printer service)</li>
      <li>Any required witnesses who are not named in the document and who meet the hospital's visitor rules</li>
    </ul>

    <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:12px;">
      If the patient has limited mobility or is unable to sign in their usual way, let us know beforehand so we can discuss acceptable options under California notary law.
    </p>

    <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:12px;">
      If ID is at home, we recommend having a family member bring it to the hospital before the appointment. In some cases, credible witnesses may be an option; we will discuss this with you in advance based on California law.

    <h2 style="font-size:22px; margin-bottom:10px;">Mobile notary FAQ for Cedars-Sinai Medical Center</h2>

    <div class="faq-block" style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6;">
      <p class="faq-question">Can you notarize documents in Cedars-Sinai's ICU or specialized units?</p>
      <p class="faq-answer">
        Yes, we can visit patients in ICU and specialized units as long as the hospital permits visitors and the patient is alert enough to understand and sign the documents. Cedars treats many high-acuity patients, so we work closely with family members and nursing staff to find a time when the patient is stable, awake, and able to participate. If the medical team advises against a signing at a particular time, we defer to their judgment and adjust as needed.
      </p>

      <p class="faq-question">Does Cedars-Sinai provide its own notary service?</p>
      <p class="faq-answer">
        Some large hospitals occasionally have internal notary options, but availability can be limited and restricted to certain types of forms. We operate as an independent mobile notary service that you hire directly. Families often call us when the hospital cannot provide a notary in the needed timeframe or for the specific documents involved, such as estate planning documents prepared by an outside attorney.
      </p>

      <p class="faq-question">How long does it take you to get to Cedars from Granada Hills?</p>
      <p class="faq-answer">
        Travel time to Beverly Grove typically ranges from 35-60 minutes depending on traffic on the 101, 405, and surface streets like Beverly, 3rd Street, or Fairfax. During rush hour, it can take longer. We always check real-time conditions before confirming your arrival window and will update you by text if delays are expected.
      </p>

      <p class="faq-question">Can you help coordinate with my estate planning attorney or financial advisor?</p>
      <p class="faq-answer">
        Yes. Many Cedars patients work with outside attorneys or advisors who prepare documents for signature at the hospital. Your attorney can email documents to you or directly to us for printing using our laptop and portable printer service. We do not give legal advice or recommend specific documents, but we make sure the paperwork your attorney provides is printed, organized, and ready to sign and notarize.
      </p>

      <p class="faq-question">What if parking at Cedars-Sinai is full when you arrive?</p>
      <p class="faq-answer">
        Parking garages at Cedars can reach capacity at busy times. We allow extra time to find parking and may use alternative lots or street parking if needed. We keep you updated by text so you know our status and do not have to guess whether we are on the way, parked, or walking to your building.
      </p>

      <p class="faq-question">Do you serve nearby neighborhoods like West Hollywood and Beverly Hills as well?</p>
      <p class="faq-answer">
        Yes. In addition to Cedars-Sinai itself, we serve patients and families at nearby medical offices, rehab facilities, and residences in Beverly Grove, West Hollywood, Beverly Hills, Carthay, and the surrounding area. If the patient is discharged to a nearby facility or home, we can continue to assist with notarizations there as well.
