    <h2 style="font-size:24px; margin-bottom:10px;">
      Bedside notary visits at a major Los Angeles hospital
    </h2>
    <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:12px;">
      Cedars-Sinai Medical Center is one of the largest nonprofit academic medical centers in the United States, located at 8700 Beverly Boulevard in the Beverly Grove neighborhood of Los Angeles. The main campus spans nearly 24 acres and 4.4 million square feet, with 915 licensed beds, over 2,100 physicians, and 2,800 nurses. Major buildings on campus include the main hospital towers, the Saperstein Critical Care Tower (120 ICU rooms), the Advanced Health Sciences Pavilion, and multiple outpatient centers.
    </p>
    <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:12px;">
      Cedars-Sinai is nationally recognized for cardiology, cancer care, transplant programs, neurology, gastroenterology, and many other specialties. The medical center saw over 51,000 admissions and 131,000 emergency visits in its most recent fiscal year, making it one of the busiest hospital campuses in Southern California.
    </p>
    <ul style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.8; margin-left:18px; margin-bottom:16px;">
      <li><strong>Address:</strong> 8700 Beverly Boulevard, Los Angeles, CA 90048</li>
      <li><strong>Main phone:</strong> (310) 423&#8209;3277</li>
      <li><strong>Emergency department:</strong> (310) 423&#8209;8605 (open 24 hours)</li>
      <li><strong>Visiting hours:</strong> 10:00 AM &#8211; 9:00 PM daily (some units have special hours)</li>
      <li><strong>Parking:</strong> Multiple garages and valet available on campus; can be busy on weekdays</li>
    </ul>
    <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:12px;">
      Because Cedars-Sinai is in central Los Angeles and traffic to Beverly Grove can be unpredictable, this facility is part of our Tier 2 service area. We factor additional travel and parking time into scheduling and pricing so we can arrive prepared and on time.

    <div class="two-column-section">
      <div>
        <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:12px;">
          We coordinate with you by phone or text to confirm the patient&#8217;s legal name, room number, and the documents that need notarization. Because the Cedars campus is large and multi-building, we will also ask which tower or wing the patient is in so we can find you efficiently once we arrive.
        </p>
        <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:12px;">
          When we get to Cedars, we check in at the appropriate entrance, follow hospital visitor procedures, and then meet you in the patient room or a quiet family area. Our goal is to keep the visit calm, efficient, and respectful of the medical team, especially in higher-acuity units like the Saperstein Critical Care Tower.
        </p>
        <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:12px;">
          Parking garages and valet areas at Cedars can be busy, particularly on weekdays. We include time for parking and walking the campus in our arrival estimate and will text you when we are on-site so you know we are close.

    <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:12px;">
      To keep your visit smooth, please have:
    </p>

    <ul style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.8; margin-left:18px; margin-bottom:16px;">
      <li>A valid, government-issued photo ID for each signer (driver license, state ID, passport, or other accepted identification)</li>
      <li>All pages of the documents printed and ready, not just the signature page (unless using our laptop/printer service)</li>
      <li>Any required witnesses who are not named in the document and who meet the hospital&#8217;s visitor rules</li>
    </ul>

    <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:12px;">
      If the patient has limited mobility or is unable to sign in their usual way, let us know beforehand so we can discuss acceptable options under California notary law.
    </p>

    <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:12px;">
      If ID is at home, we recommend having a family member bring it to the hospital before the appointment. In some cases, credible witnesses may be an option; we will discuss this with you in advance based on California law.

    <h2 style="font-size:22px; margin-bottom:10px;">Mobile notary FAQ for Cedars-Sinai Medical Center</h2>

    <div class="faq-block" style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6;">
      <p class="faq-question">Can you notarize documents in Cedars-Sinai&#8217;s ICU or specialized units?</p>
      <p class="faq-answer">
        Yes, we can visit patients in ICU and specialized units &#8212; including the Saperstein Critical Care Tower &#8212; as long as the hospital permits visitors and the patient is alert enough to understand and sign the documents. Cedars treats many high-acuity patients, so we work closely with family members and nursing staff to find a time when the patient is stable, awake, and able to participate. If the medical team advises against a signing at a particular time, we defer to their judgment and adjust as needed.
      </p>

      <p class="faq-question">Does Cedars-Sinai provide its own notary service?</p>
      <p class="faq-answer">
        Some large hospitals occasionally have internal notary options, but availability can be limited and restricted to certain types of forms. We operate as an independent mobile notary service that you hire directly. Families often call us when the hospital cannot provide a notary in the needed timeframe or for the specific documents involved, such as estate planning documents prepared by an outside attorney.
      </p>

      <p class="faq-question">What are Cedars-Sinai&#8217;s visiting hours?</p>
      <p class="faq-answer">
        General visiting hours at Cedars-Sinai are 10:00 AM to 9:00 PM daily. Some units may have special visiting hours. We coordinate our arrival within allowed visiting windows or work with your family to confirm access for professional visits outside standard hours when the hospital permits it.
      </p>

      <p class="faq-question">How long does it take you to get to Cedars from Granada Hills?</p>
      <p class="faq-answer">
        Travel time to Beverly Grove typically ranges from 35&#8211;60 minutes depending on traffic on the 101, 405, and surface streets like Beverly, 3rd Street, or Fairfax. During rush hour, it can take longer. We always check real-time conditions before confirming your arrival window and will update you by text if delays are expected.
      </p>

      <p class="faq-question">Can you help coordinate with my estate planning attorney or financial advisor?</p>
      <p class="faq-answer">
        Yes. Many Cedars patients work with outside attorneys or advisors who prepare documents for signature at the hospital. Your attorney can email documents to you or directly to us for printing using our laptop and portable printer service. We do not give legal advice or recommend specific documents, but we make sure the paperwork your attorney provides is printed, organized, and ready to sign and notarize.
      </p>

      <p class="faq-question">What if parking at Cedars-Sinai is full when you arrive?</p>
      <p class="faq-answer">
        Parking garages at Cedars can reach capacity at busy times. We allow extra time to find parking and may use alternative lots or street parking if needed. We keep you updated by text so you know our status and do not have to guess whether we are on the way, parked, or walking to your building.
      </p>

      <p class="faq-question">Do you serve nearby neighborhoods like West Hollywood and Beverly Hills as well?</p>
      <p class="faq-answer">
        Yes. In addition to Cedars-Sinai itself, we serve patients and families at nearby medical offices, rehab facilities, and residences in Beverly Grove, West Hollywood, Beverly Hills, Carthay, and the surrounding area. If the patient is discharged to a nearby facility or home, we can continue to assist with notarizations there as well.
