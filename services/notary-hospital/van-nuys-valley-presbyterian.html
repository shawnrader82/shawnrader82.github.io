      Bedside notary visits in Van Nuys
    </h2>
    <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:12px;">
      Valley Presbyterian Hospital is one of the largest independent acute-care hospitals in the San Fernando Valley, located at 15107 Vanowen Street in Van Nuys. With approximately 350 licensed beds, the facility offers emergency services, surgical care, cardiac services, orthopedics, a family birth center, and a broad range of inpatient specialties. Valley Presbyterian serves a large and diverse community across central and east San Fernando Valley, including Van Nuys, Sherman Oaks, North Hollywood, Panorama City, and Lake Balboa.
    </p>
    <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:12px;">
      As one of our Tier 1 (nearby) hospitals, Valley Presbyterian is a short drive from our Granada Hills base via the 405 or surface streets, which means we can often respond quickly for same-day or next-day appointments.

    <h2 style="font-size:22px; margin-bottom:10px;">What to expect when you book</h2>

    <div class="two-column-section">
      <div>
        <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:12px;">
          We coordinate with you by phone or text to confirm the patient's legal name, room number, and the documents that need notarization. When we arrive, we check in at the main entrance or information desk, follow hospital visitor procedures, and then meet you in the patient room or a designated family area.
        </p>
        <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:12px;">
          Our goal is to keep the visit calm, efficient, and respectful of doctors and nurses who may need access to the patient. If the patient is in the ICU, undergoing tests, or has visitor restrictions, let us know ahead of time so we can plan accordingly.
        </p>
        <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:12px;">
          Valley Presbyterian has surface parking and a visitor check-in process. We factor parking and access time into our arrival estimate and will text you when we are on-site so you know we are close.

    <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:12px;">
      To keep your visit smooth, please have:
    </p>

    <ul style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.8; margin-left:18px; margin-bottom:16px;">
      <li>A valid, government-issued photo ID for each signer (driver license, state ID, passport, or other accepted identification)</li>
      <li>All pages of the documents printed and ready, not just the signature page (unless using our laptop/printer service)</li>
      <li>Any required witnesses who are not named in the document and who meet the hospital's visitor rules</li>
    </ul>

    <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:12px;">
      If the patient has limited mobility or is unable to sign in their usual way, let us know beforehand so we can discuss acceptable options under California notary law.
    </p>

    <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:12px;">
      If ID is at home, we recommend having a family member bring it to the hospital before the appointment. In some cases, credible witnesses may be an option; we will discuss this with you in advance based on California law.

    <h2 style="font-size:22px; margin-bottom:10px;">Mobile notary FAQ for Valley Presbyterian Hospital</h2>

    <div class="faq-block" style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6;">
      <p class="faq-question">How quickly can you get to Valley Presbyterian from Granada Hills?</p>
      <p class="faq-answer">
        Valley Presbyterian is one of our closer hospitals. Travel time is typically 15-30 minutes via the 405 or Van Nuys Boulevard depending on traffic. During business hours, we can often arrive within 1-2 hours for urgent requests, or schedule same-day when our calendar allows. We always confirm a specific arrival window when you book.
      </p>

      <p class="faq-question">Does Valley Presbyterian have a busy emergency department?</p>
      <p class="faq-answer">
        Yes, Valley Presbyterian has one of the busier ERs in the central San Fernando Valley. If your family member was admitted through the emergency room and is now in a regular room, that is the ideal time to schedule a notary visit. If they are still in the ER, we can sometimes visit there as well, but the environment is less predictable and we may need to wait for a quieter moment.
      </p>

      <p class="faq-question">Can you notarize for a patient who primarily speaks Spanish?</p>
      <p class="faq-answer">
        Valley Presbyterian serves a large Spanish-speaking community. The signer must be able to communicate with the notary to confirm their identity and understanding of the document. I can communicate in basic Spanish, which can help facilitate the process. A bilingual family member can also serve as an interpreter. We cannot notarize if there is no way to confirm the signer understands what they are signing.
      </p>

      <p class="faq-question">What if the patient needs to sign but is connected to IVs or monitors?</p>
      <p class="faq-answer">
        Medical equipment does not prevent a notarization as long as the patient can hold a pen (or make a mark) and is mentally alert enough to understand the documents. We work around IV lines, monitors, and bed positioning regularly. We bring a clipboard and can adjust our setup to whatever is most comfortable for the patient. If the patient cannot hold a pen at all, California law allows for signature by mark with proper witnesses.
      </p>

      <p class="faq-question">Do you also serve Sherman Oaks, North Hollywood, and Panorama City?</p>
      <p class="faq-answer">
        Yes. Valley Presbyterian draws patients from across the central San Fernando Valley. We serve patients and families at hospitals, homes, skilled nursing facilities, and assisted living communities in Van Nuys, Sherman Oaks, North Hollywood, Panorama City, Lake Balboa, and surrounding neighborhoods. If the patient is discharged to a facility or home in any of these areas, we can follow up there as well.
      </p>

      <p class="faq-question">Can I schedule a notary visit for the day of discharge?</p>
      <p class="faq-answer">
        Discharge-day notarizations are common but require careful timing. Hospitals sometimes discharge patients earlier or later than expected, so we recommend scheduling the signing as early in the day as possible to avoid conflicts. Let us know the estimated discharge time and we will work around it. If the patient is discharged before we arrive, we can redirect to their home or next destination.
