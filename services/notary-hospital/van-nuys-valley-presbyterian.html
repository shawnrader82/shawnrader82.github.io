      Valley Presbyterian Hospital (VPH) is a 350-bed, independent, non-sectarian, nonprofit general acute care hospital located at 15107 Vanowen Street in Van Nuys, CA 91405. Established in 1958 as a small neighborhood provider, VPH has grown into the <strong>largest independent nonprofit hospital in the San Fernando Valley</strong>, serving more than 100,000 patients per year. The hospital&#8217;s 10 consecutive LA Daily News Readers&#8217; Choice Awards for Best Hospital reflect its deep ties to the community.
    </p>
    <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:12px;">

      <div>
        <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:12px;">
          We coordinate with you by phone or text to confirm the patient&#8217;s legal name, room number, and the documents that need notarization. When we arrive, we check in at the main entrance or information desk, follow hospital visitor procedures, and then meet you in the patient room or a designated family area.
        </p>
        <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:12px;">
          Inpatient visiting hours at Valley Presbyterian are <strong>5:00 AM to 9:00 PM</strong> with a maximum of two visitors at a time. Visitors experiencing cold, flu, RSV, COVID-19 symptoms, or any infectious disease are not permitted to enter. The NICU, Pediatrics, and PICU allow parents and guardians to visit 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. In Labor &amp; Delivery, one designated support person has 24-hour visiting privileges while a second support person may visit between 5:00 AM and 9:00 PM. Maternity units observe a &#8220;Daily Quiet Time&#8221; from 1:00 PM to 3:00 PM during which visitation is not permitted. Visitors to patients on isolation precautions must check with a nurse for specific PPE instructions before entering the room.
        </p>
        <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:12px;">
          Our goal is to keep the visit calm, efficient, and respectful of doctors and nurses who may need access to the patient. If the patient is in the ICU, PICU, NICU, or has visitor restrictions, let us know ahead of time so we can plan accordingly.
        </p>
        <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:12px;">
          Valley Presbyterian has surface parking lots on campus. We factor parking and access time into our arrival estimate and will text you when we are on-site so you know we are close.

        Inpatient visiting hours are <strong>5:00 AM to 9:00 PM</strong> with a maximum of two visitors at a time. The NICU, Pediatrics, and PICU allow parents and guardians to visit 24/7. In Labor &amp; Delivery, one designated support person has 24-hour visiting privileges while a second may visit between 5:00 AM and 9:00 PM. Maternity units observe &#8220;Daily Quiet Time&#8221; from 1:00 PM to 3:00 PM with no visitation. Barlow Respiratory Hospital on the VPH campus has visiting hours from 10:00 AM to 9:00 PM with two visitors at a time. Visitors experiencing symptoms of illness are not permitted to enter. We schedule our notary visit to fall within these hours and coordinate with you on any unit-specific restrictions.

      <p class="faq-question">Does Valley Presbyterian have a busy emergency department?</p>
      <p class="faq-answer">
        Yes. Valley Presbyterian&#8217;s Emergency Department treats more than 60,000 patients per year, making it one of the busiest in the central San Fernando Valley. The ER is a Certified Primary Stroke Center, STEMI Receiving Center, EDAP facility, and designated Pediatric Medical Center. If your family member was admitted through the ER and is now in a regular room, that is the ideal time to schedule a notary visit. If they are still in the ER, we can sometimes visit there as well, but the environment is less predictable and we may need to wait for a quieter moment.

      <p class="faq-question">Can you notarize for a patient who primarily speaks Spanish?</p>
      <p class="faq-answer">
        Valley Presbyterian serves a large Spanish-speaking community. The signer must be able to communicate with the notary to confirm their identity and understanding of the document. I can communicate in basic Spanish, which can help facilitate the process. A bilingual family member can also serve as an interpreter. We cannot notarize if there is no way to confirm the signer understands what they are signing.
      </p>

      <p class="faq-question">What if the patient needs to sign but is connected to IVs or monitors?</p>
      <p class="faq-answer">
        Medical equipment does not prevent a notarization as long as the patient can hold a pen (or make a mark) and is mentally alert enough to understand the documents. We work around IV lines, monitors, and bed positioning regularly. We bring a clipboard and can adjust our setup to whatever is most comfortable for the patient. If the patient cannot hold a pen at all, California law allows for signature by mark with proper witnesses.
      </p>

      <p class="faq-question">Do you also serve Sherman Oaks, North Hollywood, and Panorama City?</p>
      <p class="faq-answer">
        Yes. Valley Presbyterian draws patients from across the central San Fernando Valley. We serve patients and families at hospitals, homes, skilled nursing facilities, and assisted living communities in Van Nuys, Sherman Oaks, North Hollywood, Panorama City, Lake Balboa, and surrounding neighborhoods. If the patient is discharged to a facility or home in any of these areas, we can follow up there as well.
      </p>

      <p class="faq-question">Can I schedule a notary visit for the day of discharge?</p>
      <p class="faq-answer">
        Discharge-day notarizations are common but require careful timing. Hospitals sometimes discharge patients earlier or later than expected, so we recommend scheduling the signing as early in the day as possible to avoid conflicts. Let us know the estimated discharge time and we will work around it. If the patient is discharged before we arrive, we can redirect to their home or next destination.
