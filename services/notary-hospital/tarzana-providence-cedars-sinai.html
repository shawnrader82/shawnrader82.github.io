          We coordinate with you by phone or text to confirm the patient&#8217;s legal name, room number, and the documents that need notarization. When we arrive, we check in at the main entrance or security desk, follow hospital visitor procedures, and then meet you in the patient room or a designated family area.
        </p>
        <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:12px;">
          Providence Cedars-Sinai Tarzana supports <strong>open visitation</strong>, allowing visitors at any time of the day or night. Quiet hours are observed from 10:00 PM to 6:00 AM. Visitors on the premises during quiet hours are required to stay primarily in the patient&#8217;s room and immediate vicinity. This open policy gives us significant flexibility to schedule notary visits at times that work best for the patient and family.
        </p>
        <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:12px;">
          Our goal is to keep the visit calm, efficient, and respectful of doctors and nurses who may need access to the patient. If the patient is in the ICU, NICU, cardiac unit, or another restricted area, let us know ahead of time so we can plan around any unit-specific access rules.
        </p>
        <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:12px;">
          Providence Tarzana has a parking structure accessible from Clark Street. We factor parking and walking time into our arrival estimate and will text you when we are on-site so you know we are close.

      <p class="faq-answer">
        Providence Tarzana is one of our closer hospitals. Travel time is typically 20&#8211;35 minutes via Reseda Boulevard or the 101 freeway depending on traffic. During business hours, we can often arrive within 1&#8211;2 hours for urgent requests, or schedule same-day when our calendar allows. We always confirm a specific arrival window when you book.

      <p class="faq-question">Can you notarize documents for a patient in the NICU or maternity ward?</p>
      <p class="faq-answer">
        Yes. Providence Tarzana has the largest Level III NICU in the San Fernando Valley. We can visit parents in the NICU or maternity unit to notarize documents like powers of attorney or guardianship forms. These units often have stricter visitor policies, so we coordinate with you and the nursing staff to find a time that works without disrupting care. The parent who needs to sign must have valid ID and be able to understand the documents.

      <p class="faq-question">What if the patient came in through the emergency room and is now admitted?</p>
      <p class="faq-answer">
        This is one of the most common scenarios we handle. The ER at Providence Tarzana has 32 ultra-modern treatment bays and is open 24/7. Once a patient is admitted from the ER and assigned a room, we can schedule a visit. If the patient is still in the ER but stable and in a bed, we may be able to visit there as well, though ER environments are less predictable. Let us know the situation and we will advise on the best timing.

      <p class="faq-question">Do you also serve Encino Hospital Medical Center nearby?</p>
      <p class="faq-answer">
        Yes. Encino Hospital Medical Center on Ventura Boulevard is close to Providence Tarzana &#8212; about two miles east &#8212; and we serve both facilities at Tier 1 rates. If you are unsure which hospital your family member is at, just give us the address or facility name when you call and we will confirm pricing and travel time.

      <p class="faq-question">Can the hospital social worker arrange a notary instead?</p>
      <p class="faq-answer">
        Some hospitals have occasional access to notary services through social work or patient services departments, but availability is often limited and may not cover all document types. Families frequently contact us when the hospital cannot provide a notary in the needed timeframe, especially for evening, weekend, or complex multi-document signings. We operate independently and can usually schedule faster than most hospital-arranged options.
