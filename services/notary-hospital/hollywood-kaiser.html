      Bedside notary visits on Sunset Boulevard
    </h2>
    <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:12px;">
      Kaiser Permanente Los Angeles Medical Center is one of the largest Kaiser facilities in Southern California, located at 4867 Sunset Boulevard in the East Hollywood area of Los Angeles. The campus includes a hospital, multiple medical office buildings, and specialty departments serving a large membership base across central and eastern Los Angeles. The facility handles complex surgeries, oncology, cardiac care, transplant services, and a wide range of inpatient specialties.
    </p>
    <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:12px;">
      This location is part of our Tier 2 service area due to the drive from our Granada Hills base through Hollywood and central LA. Traffic on the 101 and surface streets near Sunset Boulevard can vary significantly, so we build additional travel time into scheduling and pricing.

    <div class="two-column-section">
      <div>
        <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:12px;">
          We coordinate with you by phone or text to confirm the patient's legal name, room number, building, and the documents that need notarization. The Kaiser LA campus is large with multiple buildings, so knowing the exact location saves time once we arrive.
        </p>
        <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:12px;">
          When we arrive, we check in at the hospital entrance, follow Kaiser visitor procedures, and then meet you in the patient room or a designated family area. Our goal is to keep the visit calm, efficient, and respectful of the medical team.
        </p>
        <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:12px;">
          Parking at Kaiser LA can be tight, especially during weekday business hours. We factor parking time into our arrival estimate and recommend that you confirm the building and floor so we can navigate the campus efficiently and text you when we are close.

      <strong>Important:</strong> I am a commissioned notary public, not an attorney. I do not provide legal advice, recommend specific documents, or explain your legal rights.

For legal questions or to decide which documents are appropriate for your situation, please consult a licensed attorney.

    <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:12px;">
      To keep your visit smooth, please have:
    </p>

    <ul style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.8; margin-left:18px; margin-bottom:16px;">
      <li>A valid, government-issued photo ID for each signer (driver license, state ID, passport, or other accepted identification)</li>
      <li>All pages of the documents printed and ready, not just the signature page (unless using our laptop/printer service)</li>
      <li>Any required witnesses who are not named in the document and who meet the hospital's visitor rules</li>
    </ul>

    <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:12px;">
      If the patient has limited mobility or is unable to sign in their usual way, let us know beforehand so we can discuss acceptable options under California notary law.
    </p>

    <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:12px;">
      If ID is at home, we recommend having a family member bring it to the hospital before the appointment. In some cases, credible witnesses may be an option; we will discuss this with you in advance based on California law.

    <div class="faq-block" style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6;">
      <p class="faq-question">Is this the same Kaiser as the one in Woodland Hills?</p>
      <p class="faq-answer">
        No. Kaiser Permanente Los Angeles Medical Center on Sunset Boulevard in Hollywood is a separate, larger facility from Kaiser Permanente Woodland Hills. The Sunset campus is Kaiser's flagship Los Angeles hospital with more specialty services and a bigger inpatient capacity. If your family member is at the Woodland Hills location, see our <a href="/services/notary-hospital/woodland-hills-kaiser.html">Kaiser Woodland Hills page</a> for Tier 1 pricing and details.
      </p>

      <p class="faq-question">How long does it take to get to Kaiser LA Sunset from Granada Hills?</p>
      <p class="faq-answer">
        The drive from Granada Hills to the Sunset Boulevard campus typically takes 35-55 minutes via the 101 or 170 freeways, but Hollywood traffic can push that well past an hour during rush hour or event days. We always check real-time conditions and confirm a specific arrival window when you book. If you need a faster response, calling or texting rather than booking online helps us prioritize and confirm timing quickly.
      </p>

      <p class="faq-question">The Kaiser LA campus is large. How do I direct you to the right building?</p>
      <p class="faq-answer">
        When you contact us, let us know the specific building name or number, the floor, and the unit or room number. If you are unsure, ask the nursing station for directions you can relay. We will text you when we arrive on campus so you can guide us if needed. The more specific you can be about location, the faster we can reach you once we park.
      </p>

      <p class="faq-question">Can you notarize for a patient awaiting or recovering from transplant surgery?</p>
      <p class="faq-answer">
        Yes. Kaiser LA handles complex transplant cases, and families often need powers of attorney or healthcare directives notarized before or after major procedures. The patient must be alert and able to demonstrate understanding of the documents at the time of signing. We recommend scheduling during a window when the patient is typically most alert, and we can coordinate with nursing staff to find appropriate timing.
      </p>

      <p class="faq-question">Do I need to be a Kaiser member for you to come to this hospital?</p>
      <p class="faq-answer">
        No. Our mobile notary service is completely independent from Kaiser Permanente. We come to the hospital to notarize documents for any patient, family member, or visitor regardless of insurance or membership status. You are hiring us directly as a mobile notary.
      </p>

      <p class="faq-question">What if parking is full when you arrive?</p>
      <p class="faq-answer">
        Parking at the Kaiser LA campus can be competitive, especially during weekday business hours. We build extra time into our arrival window to account for parking challenges. If parking structures are full, we may use nearby street parking or alternative lots. We will keep you updated by text so you know our status and do not have to wonder when we are arriving.
