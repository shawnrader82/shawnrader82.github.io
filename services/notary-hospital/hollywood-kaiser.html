The main hospital is located at 4867 Sunset Boulevard in the East Hollywood area of Los Angeles (ZIP 90027). The campus spans multiple city blocks along Sunset Boulevard, with medical office buildings at 4700, 4760, 4900, and 4950 W. Sunset Blvd., plus additional facilities on Vermont Avenue and Edgemont Street. It is Kaiser&#8217;s flagship LA hospital, offering complex surgeries, bone marrow and liver transplant services, oncology, cardiac care, and a full range of inpatient specialties.
    </p>
    <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:12px;">
      The campus is currently undergoing a multi-phase expansion project that will add new medical office buildings, a procedure center, and parking structures across several sites along Sunset Boulevard, Vermont Avenue, and adjacent streets. Admitting is available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week on the 1st floor of the main hospital at 4867 W. Sunset Blvd.

        <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:12px;">
          We coordinate with you by phone or text to confirm the patient&#8217;s legal name, room number, building, and the documents that need notarization. The Kaiser LA campus spans multiple blocks with buildings at 4700, 4760, 4867, 4900, and 4950 W. Sunset Blvd. plus offices on Vermont Avenue and Edgemont Street, so knowing the exact building and floor saves significant time once we arrive.
        </p>
        <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:12px;">
          Kaiser LA has open visiting hours with no set time restrictions, though hospital quiet hours are observed from 9:00 PM to 5:00 AM. All visitors must check in at registration and meet hospital visitor requirements. We schedule our notary visit to avoid quiet hours when possible, and coordinate with you to find the best window for the patient.
        </p>
        <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:12px;">
          Parking at Kaiser LA can be tight, especially during weekday business hours when multiple parking structures fill up. We factor parking time into our arrival estimate and will text you when we are on campus. If you are unsure which building the patient is in, call the hospital operator at (323) 783&#8209;4011 to confirm before our visit.

      To keep your visit smooth, please have:
    </p>

    <ul style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.8; margin-left:18px; margin-bottom:16px;">
      <li>A valid, government-issued photo ID for each signer (driver license, state ID, passport, or other accepted identification)</li>
      <li>All pages of the documents printed and ready, not just the signature page (unless using our laptop/printer service)</li>

    <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:12px;">
      If the patient has limited mobility or is unable to sign in their usual way, let us know beforehand so we can discuss acceptable options under California notary law.
    </p>

    <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:12px;">
      If ID is at home, we recommend having a family member bring it to the hospital before the appointment. In some cases, credible witnesses may be an option; we will discuss this with you in advance based on California law.

    <div class="faq-block" style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6;">
      <p class="faq-question">Is this the same Kaiser as the one in Woodland Hills?</p>
      <p class="faq-answer">
        No. Kaiser Permanente Los Angeles Medical Center on Sunset Boulevard is a separate, much larger 492-bed facility from Kaiser Permanente Woodland Hills. The Sunset campus is Kaiser&#8217;s flagship Los Angeles hospital with more specialty services, transplant programs, and a bigger inpatient capacity. If your family member is at the Woodland Hills location, see our <a href="/services/notary-hospital/woodland-hills-kaiser.html">Kaiser Woodland Hills page</a> for Tier 1 pricing and details.
      </p>

      <p class="faq-question">What are visiting hours at Kaiser LA on Sunset?</p>
      <p class="faq-answer">
        Kaiser Permanente Los Angeles Medical Center has open visiting hours with no set time restrictions. However, hospital quiet hours are observed from 9:00 PM to 5:00 AM, and all visitors must check in at registration and meet hospital visitor requirements. Maternity units schedule a mother&#8211;baby quiet time each afternoon based on delivery timing. We coordinate our notary visit to avoid quiet hours and scheduling conflicts whenever possible.
      </p>

      <p class="faq-question">How long does it take to get to Kaiser LA Sunset from Granada Hills?</p>
      <p class="faq-answer">
        The drive from Granada Hills to the Sunset Boulevard campus typically takes 35&#8211;55 minutes via the 101 or 170 freeways, but Hollywood traffic can push that well past an hour during rush hour or event days. We always check real-time conditions and confirm a specific arrival window when you book. If you need a faster response, calling or texting rather than booking online helps us prioritize and confirm timing quickly.
      </p>

      <p class="faq-question">The Kaiser LA campus is large. How do I direct you to the right building?</p>
      <p class="faq-answer">
        The campus spans multiple city blocks with buildings at 4700, 4760, 4867, 4900, and 4950 W. Sunset Blvd., plus medical office buildings at 1515 N. Vermont Ave., 1505 N. Edgemont St., and other nearby addresses. When you contact us, let us know the specific building address or name, the floor, and the unit or room number. If you are unsure, call the hospital operator at (323) 783&#8209;4011 to confirm. We will text you when we arrive on campus so you can guide us if needed.

      <p class="faq-question">Can you notarize for a patient awaiting or recovering from transplant surgery?</p>
      <p class="faq-answer">
        Yes. Kaiser LA handles complex transplant cases, including liver transplants and bone marrow transplants through its dedicated Transplant Services departments. Families often need powers of attorney or healthcare directives notarized before or after major procedures. The patient must be alert and able to demonstrate understanding of the documents at the time of signing. We recommend scheduling during a window when the patient is typically most alert, and we can coordinate with nursing staff to find appropriate timing.
      </p>

      <p class="faq-question">Do I need to be a Kaiser member for you to come to this hospital?</p>
      <p class="faq-answer">
        No. Our mobile notary service is completely independent from Kaiser Permanente. We come to the hospital to notarize documents for any patient, family member, or visitor regardless of insurance or membership status. You are hiring us directly as a mobile notary.
      </p>

      <p class="faq-question">What if parking is full when you arrive?</p>
      <p class="faq-answer">
        Parking at the Kaiser LA campus can be competitive, especially during weekday business hours when multiple parking structures fill up. The campus is also in the process of building new parking structures as part of its expansion project. We build extra time into our arrival window to account for parking challenges. If structures are full, we may use nearby street parking or alternative lots. We will keep you updated by text so you know our status.
