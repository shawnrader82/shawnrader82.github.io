      Bedside notary visits in Burbank
    </h2>
    <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:12px;">
      Providence Saint Joseph Medical Center is a 446-bed Catholic hospital located at 501 South Buena Vista Street in Burbank, directly across from the Walt Disney Company world headquarters. Part of the Providence health system, the hospital offers comprehensive services including emergency care, cardiac services, orthopedics, oncology, maternity care, and rehabilitation programs. The hospital is accredited by the Commission on Accreditation of Rehabilitation Facilities (CARF) and has 383 licensed acute care beds.
    </p>
    <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:12px;">
      The campus also includes the Roy and Patricia Disney Family Cancer Center at 181 S. Buena Vista Blvd., a four-story comprehensive outpatient cancer center that is the San Fernando Valley&#8217;s only cancer program accredited by the American College of Surgeons Commission on Cancer. The Disney Cancer Center features exam rooms, a laboratory, doctors&#8217; offices, private infusion-therapy bays, and a healing garden.
    </p>
    <ul style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.8; margin-left:18px; margin-bottom:16px;">
      <li><strong>Address:</strong> 501 S. Buena Vista Street, Burbank, CA 91505</li>

    <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:12px;">
      As one of our Tier 1 (nearby) hospitals, Providence Saint Joseph is accessible via the 134 freeway from our Granada Hills base. While slightly farther than some San Fernando Valley hospitals, we can typically respond for same-day or next-day appointments depending on traffic and scheduling.

    <h2 style="font-size:22px; margin-bottom:10px;">What to expect when you book</h2>

    <div class="two-column-section">
      <div>
        <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:12px;">
          We coordinate with you by phone or text to confirm the patient&#8217;s legal name, room number, and the documents that need notarization. When we arrive, we check in at the main entrance or information desk, follow hospital visitor procedures, and then meet you in the patient room or a designated family area.
        </p>
        <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:12px;">
          Providence Saint Joseph allows visitors 24 hours a day. If we are arriving after 7:00 PM, we enter through the Emergency Department entrance and check in with the desk clerk on duty. All visitors must check in and check out upon arrival and departure. Once checked in, we are escorted to the nurse&#8217;s station.
        </p>
        <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:12px;">
          Our goal is to keep the visit calm, efficient, and respectful of doctors and nurses who may need access to the patient. If the patient is in the ICU, cancer center, undergoing tests, or has visitor restrictions, let us know ahead of time so we can plan accordingly.
        </p>
        <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:12px;">
          Travel time from Granada Hills depends on 118, 5, and 134 freeway traffic, so we will confirm an arrival window when you book that accounts for current conditions.

      Many families call from Providence Saint Joseph when time and mobility are limited. Typical documents include:
    </p>

    <ul style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.8; margin-left:18px; margin-bottom:16px;">
      <li>Advance healthcare directives and living wills</li>

    </ul>

    <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:12px;">

    <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:12px;">
      To keep your visit smooth, please have:
    </p>

    <ul style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.8; margin-left:18px; margin-bottom:16px;">
      <li>A valid, government-issued photo ID for each signer (driver license, state ID, passport, or other accepted identification)</li>
      <li>All pages of the documents printed and ready, not just the signature page (unless using our laptop/printer service)</li>
      <li>Any required witnesses who are not named in the document and who meet the hospital&#8217;s visitor rules</li>
    </ul>

    <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:12px;">
      If the patient has limited mobility or is unable to sign in their usual way, let us know beforehand so we can discuss acceptable options under California notary law.
    </p>

    <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:12px;">
      If ID is at home, we recommend having a family member bring it to the hospital before the appointment. In some cases, credible witnesses may be an option; we will discuss this with you in advance based on California law.

    <h2 style="font-size:22px; margin-bottom:10px;">Mobile notary FAQ for Providence Saint Joseph Medical Center</h2>

    <div class="faq-block" style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6;">
      <p class="faq-question">Can you notarize documents at the Disney Family Cancer Center?</p>
      <p class="faq-answer">
        Yes, we can visit patients at the Roy and Patricia Disney Family Cancer Center at 181 S. Buena Vista Blvd. on the Providence Saint Joseph campus. The Disney Cancer Center is the San Fernando Valley&#8217;s only comprehensive cancer program accredited by the American College of Surgeons Commission on Cancer. Cancer patients often need powers of attorney, healthcare directives, or estate documents notarized during treatment. We coordinate timing around chemotherapy schedules, infusion appointments, or inpatient stays to find a window when the patient is comfortable and alert.
      </p>

      <p class="faq-question">What are visiting hours at Providence Saint Joseph?</p>
      <p class="faq-answer">
        Patient visitation at Providence Saint Joseph Medical Center is available 24 hours a day. Visitors arriving between 7:00 PM and 7:00 AM enter through the Emergency Department and check in with the desk clerk on duty. All visitors must check in and check out upon arrival and departure. Once checked in, visitors are escorted to the nurse&#8217;s station. This means we can schedule notary visits outside of standard daytime hours when needed.
      </p>

      <p class="faq-question">How long does it take to get to Providence Saint Joseph from Granada Hills?</p>
      <p class="faq-answer">
        Travel time to Burbank typically runs 25&#8211;45 minutes depending on traffic on the 118, 5, and 134 freeways. Rush hour or accidents can add significant time. We always check current conditions before confirming an arrival window and will update you if delays are expected.
      </p>

      <p class="faq-question">Do you also serve Glendale Adventist or other hospitals nearby?</p>
      <p class="faq-answer">
        Yes, we serve hospitals throughout the Glendale and Burbank area. If your family member is at a different facility nearby, contact us and we can discuss availability and pricing. The same Tier 1 rates typically apply to hospitals in this general area.
      </p>

      <p class="faq-question">What if the patient is being treated for a serious illness and may not be fully alert?</p>
      <p class="faq-answer">
        We must confirm that the signer understands what they are signing and is acting willingly. For patients dealing with serious illness, pain, or medication effects, we recommend scheduling during a time when they are typically most alert &#8212; often mid-morning after medications have stabilized. If we arrive and the patient is not able to proceed, we can wait or reschedule rather than rush through a signing that might not be valid.
      </p>

      <p class="faq-question">Can family members from out of town be present via video call during the signing?</p>
      <p class="faq-answer">
        Family members can observe via video call for their own peace of mind, but only the people physically present can sign documents or serve as witnesses. If a family member needs to sign as well (for example, as an agent accepting a power of attorney), they would need their own notarization, which could potentially be done via remote online notarization depending on the document type and their location.
      </p>

      <p class="faq-question">Is there anything specific about Providence hospitals I should know?</p>
      <p class="faq-answer">
        Providence facilities generally have straightforward visitor policies. Providence Saint Joseph allows 24-hour visitation, which gives us more flexibility for evening and weekend notary appointments. If the patient is in a restricted area like the ICU or a specialized unit, confirm with nursing staff that a notary visit is permitted and coordinate a time that works with their care schedule. We are experienced with Providence facilities and can adapt to their processes.
