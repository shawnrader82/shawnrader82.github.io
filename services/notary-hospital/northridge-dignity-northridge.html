      Bedside notary visits in Northridge
    </h2>
    <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:12px;">
      Dignity Health Northridge Hospital Medical Center is a full-service hospital located at 18300 Roscoe Boulevard in Northridge, serving the San Fernando Valley community. The hospital includes a Level II trauma center, the Center for Heart & Vascular Services, a comprehensive stroke program, and a wide range of inpatient services. Families and patients here often need important documents notarized quickly without leaving the hospital, and we provide mobile notary visits directly to the facility.
    </p>
    <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:12px;">
      As one of our Tier 1 (nearby) hospitals, Northridge Hospital is just a short drive from our Granada Hills base, which means we can often respond quickly for same-day or next-day appointments.

    <div class="two-column-section">
      <div>
        <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:12px;">
          We coordinate with you by phone or text to confirm the patient's legal name, room number, and the documents that need notarization. When we arrive, we check in at the front desk or security, follow hospital visitor procedures, and then meet you in the patient room or a designated family area.
        </p>
        <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:12px;">
          Our goal is to keep the visit calm, efficient, and respectful of doctors and nurses who may need access to the patient. If the patient is in the ICU, trauma unit, undergoing tests, or has visitor restrictions, let us know ahead of time so we can plan accordingly.
        </p>
        <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:12px;">
          Northridge Hospital has a parking structure and visitor check-in process, so we build extra time into the visit for access and walking to your room. When you contact us, we will provide an arrival window so you know when to expect us.

For legal questions or to decide which documents are appropriate for your situation, please consult a licensed attorney.

    <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:12px;">
      To keep your visit smooth, please have:
    </p>

    <ul style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.8; margin-left:18px; margin-bottom:16px;">
      <li>A valid, government-issued photo ID for each signer (driver license, state ID, passport, or other accepted identification)</li>
      <li>All pages of the documents printed and ready, not just the signature page (unless using our laptop/printer service)</li>
      <li>Any required witnesses who are not named in the document and who meet the hospital's visitor rules</li>
    </ul>

    <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:12px;">
      If the patient has limited mobility or is unable to sign in their usual way, let us know beforehand so we can discuss acceptable options under California notary law.
    </p>

    <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:12px;">
      If ID is at home, we recommend having a family member bring it to the hospital before the appointment. In some cases, credible witnesses may be an option; we will discuss this with you in advance based on California law.

    <div class="service-detail-kicker">Frequently asked questions</div>
    <h2 style="font-size:22px; margin-bottom:10px;">Mobile notary FAQ for Dignity Health Northridge Hospital</h2>

    <div class="faq-block" style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6;">
      <p class="faq-question">How quickly can you get to Northridge Hospital Medical Center?</p>
      <p class="faq-answer">
        Northridge Hospital is one of our closest facilities. During business hours, we can often arrive within 1-2 hours for urgent requests, or schedule same-day when availability allows. For planned appointments, we typically have next-day availability. We will confirm a specific arrival window based on current traffic conditions on the 118 and Roscoe Boulevard.
      </p>

      <p class="faq-question">Can you visit patients in the Northridge Hospital trauma center?</p>
      <p class="faq-answer">
        Yes, we can visit trauma patients as long as the hospital permits visitors and the patient is conscious, alert, and able to understand and sign documents. Trauma situations can be unpredictable, so we coordinate closely with family members and recommend confirming visitor access with nursing staff before we arrive. If the patient's condition changes, we can reschedule or wait in a family area until they are ready.
      </p>

      <p class="faq-question">What if the patient had a stroke and has difficulty signing?</p>
      <p class="faq-answer">
        Northridge Hospital has a comprehensive stroke program, and we sometimes work with stroke patients who have limited use of their dominant hand. California law allows for signature by mark or signature with the non-dominant hand if the signer can still demonstrate understanding and intent. We assess each situation individually and will discuss options with you and the patient before proceeding.
      </p>

      <p class="faq-question">Where is visitor parking at Northridge Hospital?</p>
      <p class="faq-answer">
        Northridge Hospital has a parking structure accessible from Roscoe Boulevard near the main entrance. We include parking and check-in time in our arrival estimate. If you are in a unit far from the lobby, let us know the floor and wing so we can plan our route and text you when we are close.
      </p>

      <p class="faq-question">Can I have documents notarized for a patient who does not speak English?</p>
      <p class="faq-answer">
        The signer must be able to communicate directly with the notary to confirm their identity and understanding of the document. If the patient speaks limited English, a trusted interpreter (often a bilingual family member) can help facilitate communication. I can also communicate in basic Spanish if that helps. We cannot notarize if there is no way to confirm the signer understands what they are signing.
      </p>

      <p class="faq-question">What happens if the notarization takes longer than expected?</p>
      <p class="faq-answer">
        Hospital notarizations sometimes take longer due to interruptions from medical staff, the patient needing rest, or documents requiring additional review. Our hospital visit fee covers reasonable time for a typical bedside signing. If significant delays occur due to factors outside normal circumstances, we will discuss any adjustments with you transparently before additional charges apply.
