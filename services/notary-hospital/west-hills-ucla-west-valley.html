    <div class="two-column-section">
      <div>
        <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:12px;">
          We coordinate with you by phone or text to confirm the patient&#8217;s legal name, unit, and room number, along with the documents that need notarization. When we arrive, we park in the visitor parking areas, follow hospital visitor procedures, and then meet you in the patient room or a designated family area.
        </p>
        <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:12px;">
          Visiting hours at UCLA West Valley Medical Center are <strong>8:00 AM to 8:00 PM daily</strong>. Visitation is limited to <strong>2 visitors per patient</strong> at a time. In the Emergency Department, 2 visitors are allowed for patients in rooms and 1 visitor for patients in hallway beds. Visitors must be in generally good health without infections or communicable diseases, and it is strongly recommended that visitors be over the age of 12. Children in waiting areas must be accompanied by an adult at all times. Exceptions may be granted for religious visitation or a designated support person for a patient with a disability, subject to infection control protocols.
        </p>
        <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:12px;">
          Our goal is to keep the visit calm, efficient, and respectful of the medical team. If the patient is in a higher-acuity unit, the burn center, or has specific visiting restrictions, let us know so we can schedule the signing during an appropriate window.
        </p>
        <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:12px;">
          The UCLA West Valley campus includes multiple buildings along Medical Center Drive and Woodlake Avenue. Parking is generally more manageable than at some larger LA campuses, but we still build in extra time for parking and walking. We will text you when we are on-site so you know we are close.

    <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:12px;">
      To keep your visit smooth, please have:
    </p>

    <ul style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.8; margin-left:18px; margin-bottom:16px;">
      <li>A valid, government-issued photo ID for each signer (driver license, state ID, passport, or other accepted identification)</li>
      <li>All pages of the documents printed and ready, not just the signature page (unless using our laptop/printer service)</li>
      <li>Any required witnesses who are not named in the document and who meet the hospital&#8217;s visitor rules</li>

    <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:12px;">
      If the patient has limited mobility or is unable to sign in their usual way, let us know beforehand so we can discuss acceptable options under California notary law.
    </p>

    <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:12px;">
      If ID is at home, we recommend having a family member bring it to the hospital before the appointment. In some cases, credible witnesses may be an option; we will discuss this with you in advance based on California law.

It is a separate facility from Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center in Westwood and UCLA Santa Monica Medical Center. If your family member is at the Westwood location, see our <a href="/services/notary-hospital/westwood-ucla.html">UCLA Westwood page</a>. If they are at the Santa Monica campus, mention that when you contact us so we can confirm travel time and pricing.

      <p class="faq-question">What are visiting hours at UCLA West Valley Medical Center?</p>
      <p class="faq-answer">
        Visiting hours are <strong>8:00 AM to 8:00 PM daily</strong>. Visitation is limited to 2 visitors per patient at a time. In the Emergency Department, 2 visitors are allowed for patients in rooms and 1 visitor for patients in hallway beds. Visitors must be in generally good health, and it is strongly recommended they be over 12 years old. Children in waiting areas must be accompanied by an adult. Exceptions may apply for religious visitation or a designated support person for a patient with a disability. We schedule our notary visit within these hours and coordinate with you on any unit-specific restrictions.

      <p class="faq-question">How long does it take you to get to UCLA West Valley from Granada Hills?</p>
      <p class="faq-answer">
        Travel time to West Hills usually ranges from 25&#8211;40 minutes depending on traffic on the 118, Topanga Canyon, or De Soto. Because this is still within the San Fernando Valley, we treat it as a Tier 1 hospital and can often provide same-day or next-day appointments. We always check real-time conditions and confirm a specific arrival window when you book.
      </p>

      <p class="faq-question">Do you also serve nearby areas like Calabasas and Woodland Hills?</p>
      <p class="faq-answer">
        Yes. In addition to UCLA West Valley itself, we serve homes, medical offices, and senior communities in West Hills, Canoga Park, Woodland Hills, Chatsworth, Porter Ranch, and Calabasas. If the patient is discharged to a facility or residence in any of these areas, we can continue to assist with notarizations there as well at Tier 1 rates.
      </p>

      <p class="faq-question">Can you coordinate with my attorney or financial advisor for documents?</p>
      <p class="faq-answer">
        Absolutely. Many West Valley patients work with outside attorneys or advisors who prepare documents for signing at the hospital. Your attorney can email documents to you or directly to us for printing using our laptop and portable printer service. We do not provide legal advice, but we make sure the paperwork your professional team prepares is printed, organized, and ready to sign and notarize.
      </p>

      <p class="faq-question">Is the parking situation easier here than at larger Los Angeles hospitals?</p>
      <p class="faq-answer">
        Generally yes. The UCLA West Valley campus spans several buildings along Medical Center Drive and Woodlake Avenue, with surface parking that is typically less congested than major campuses like UCLA Westwood or Cedars-Sinai. We still plan for extra time to park and walk in, and we text you when we are on-site so you know when to expect us.
      </p>

      <p class="faq-question">Can you meet family members in the lobby instead of the patient room?</p>
      <p class="faq-answer">
        Yes. If the document involves a family member rather than the patient (for example, a financial power of attorney or affidavit), we can meet in the hospital lobby, cafeteria, or another quiet spot. As long as each signer appears in person with valid ID and is willing and able to sign, we can complete the notarization there.
