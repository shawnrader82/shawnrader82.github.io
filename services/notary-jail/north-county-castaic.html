      <div class="service-detail-grid">
        <div>
          <p class="service-detail-lead">
            North County Correctional Facility is part of the Castaic jail complex in northern Los Angeles
            County. NCCF is a large, high‑security facility that houses sentenced inmates and those
            with longer stays in custody.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Location:</strong> Castaic, CA (within the Pitchess Detention Center area)</li>
            <li><strong>Operated by:</strong> Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department</li>
            <li><strong>Role:</strong> Higher‑security housing and longer‑term inmates</li>
            <li><strong>Travel time:</strong> Longer drive from central LA — plan for extended appointment windows</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3>Why inmates at NCCF need notary services</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Longer sentences</strong> — Inmates often need to delegate authority to family
              members or attorneys for finances, property, and ongoing legal matters.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Property and vehicle issues</strong> — Signing deeds, titles, and other documents
              so family can sell or manage property, vehicles, or businesses.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Estate and family planning</strong> — Powers of attorney, wills (with attorney help),
              and other planning documents.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Active legal cases</strong> — Declarations, affidavits, and other documents that
              must be signed in front of a notary.
            </li>

          <div class="faq-block" style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6;">
            <p class="faq-question">1. Contact us with the inmate's information</p>
            <p class="faq-answer">
              Call or text with the inmate's full legal name, booking number (if known), and a description
              of the documents that need to be notarized. Let us know that they are at North County
              Correctional Facility, if you already have that information.
            </p>

            <p class="faq-question">2. We confirm housing and visiting procedures</p>
            <p class="faq-answer">
              NCCF has its own schedule and rules for professional visits. We confirm that the inmate
              is currently housed at North County and review the facility's procedures so the appointment
              follows their requirements.
            </p>

            <p class="faq-question">3. Prepare your documents</p>
            <p class="faq-answer">
              Have all documents ready and complete before the appointment — we cannot draft legal documents,
              only notarize signatures. If the inmate needs to review documents first, coordinate with
              their attorney or mail the documents to the facility in advance.

            <p class="faq-question">4. The notary appointment in Castaic</p>
            <p class="faq-answer">
              We travel to North County, clear security, and meet with the inmate in the designated
              professional visiting area. The inmate confirms their identity, signs the documents in
              our presence, and we complete the notarization with the appropriate certificate.
            </p>

            <p class="faq-question">5. Document delivery</p>
            <p class="faq-answer">
              After the appointment, we return the signed and notarized documents to you, your attorney,
              escrow company, or other designated recipient — by hand delivery in the LA area, courier,
              or mail depending on your timeline.

      <h2>North County Correctional Facility Notary FAQs</h2>

      <div class="faq-block">
        <p class="faq-question">How do I confirm someone is at North County Correctional Facility?</p>
        <p class="faq-answer">
          You can search the LA County Sheriff's Inmate Information Center online at
          <a href="https://app5.lasd.org/iic/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">app5.lasd.org/iic</a>
          using the inmate's name and date of birth. The system will list the current facility,
          including North County if that is where they are housed.
        </p>

        <p class="faq-question">Can you visit both North County and Pitchess on the same day?</p>
        <p class="faq-answer">
          In some situations, yes. If you have documents for inmates at both North County and a
          Pitchess unit, let us know. We can discuss whether it is practical to coordinate both
          visits on the same trip, subject to facility schedules.
        </p>

        <p class="faq-question">Are visiting rules different at North County?</p>
        <p class="faq-answer">
          North County is a higher‑security facility with its own visiting rules and procedures
          for professional visits. We confirm current requirements with the facility to ensure
          your appointment follows their guidelines.
        </p>

        <p class="faq-question">How far in advance should I schedule an NCCF appointment?</p>
        <p class="faq-answer">
          Because of security and travel time, we recommend contacting us at least a few days in
          advance when possible. For urgent matters, call or text as soon as you know you need the
          appointment and we will review options.
        </p>

        <p class="faq-question">What ID does the inmate need?</p>
        <p class="faq-answer">
          NCCF maintains booking records with photos that can be used for identification purposes.
          If the inmate has a valid California ID, driver's license, or passport on file, that can
          also be used. We confirm ID options before the appointment.
        </p>

        <p class="faq-question">What if the inmate is transferred to another facility?</p>
        <p class="faq-answer">
          Inmates can be transferred between Castaic and downtown facilities. We recommend confirming
          the inmate's location close to the appointment time. If they have been moved, we can usually
          reschedule for the new facility with an updated quote if travel distance changes.
