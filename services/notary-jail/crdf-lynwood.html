      <h2>CRDF Lynwood Notary FAQs</h2>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>How do I confirm someone is at CRDF Lynwood?</p>
        <p>
          You can search the LA County Sheriff&#8217;s Inmate Information Center online at
          <a href="https://app5.lasd.org/iic/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">app5.lasd.org/iic</a>
          using the inmate&#8217;s name and date of birth. The system will list Century Regional
          Detention Facility if that is her current location.
        </p>

        <h3>Can CRDF notarizations help with child custody or guardianship?</p>
        <p>
          Yes. Many appointments at CRDF involve documents related to child custody, temporary
          guardianship, and school or medical authorizations. We work with you and, if needed,
          your attorney to ensure the documents are ready to sign.
        </p>

        <h3>Can I bring the documents to CRDF myself?</p>
        <p>
          Professional notary visits are separate from regular family visitation. You will need to
          get documents to us before the appointment, and we will bring them into the facility and
          return them after notarization.
        </p>

        <h3>What ID does the inmate need?</p>
        <p>
          CRDF maintains booking records with photos that can be used for identification purposes.
          If the inmate has a valid California ID, driver&#8217;s license, or passport on file, that can
          also be used. We confirm ID options before the appointment.
        </p>

        <h3>How far in advance should I schedule a CRDF appointment?</p>
        <p>
          Whenever possible, contact us several days before your deadline so we can coordinate a
          time that works with the facility&#8217;s schedule. For urgent situations, call or text as soon
          as you know you need the appointment and we will review options.
        </p>

        <h3>What if the inmate is moved to another jail?</p>
        <p>
          Women may sometimes be transferred between CRDF and other facilities. We recommend confirming
          her location close to the appointment time. If she has been moved, we can usually reschedule
          for the new facility with an updated quote if travel distance changes.
