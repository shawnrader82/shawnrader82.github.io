            <h3>1. Contact us with the inmate&#39;s information</h3>
            <p>
              Call or text with the inmate&#39;s full legal name, booking number (if known), and a
              description of the documents that need to be notarized. Let us know your deadline so
              we can prioritize scheduling.
            </p>

            <h3>2. We coordinate with Theo Lacy</h3>
            <p>
              The Theo Lacy Facility has specific procedures for professional visits. We confirm the
              current visiting schedule, any advance requirements, and ensure the inmate is available
              and housed at Theo Lacy.
            </p>

            <h3>3. Prepare your documents</h3>
            <p>
              Have all documents ready and complete before the appointment &#8212; we cannot draft legal
              documents, only notarize signatures. If the inmate needs to review documents first,
              coordinate with their attorney or use the facility&#39;s mail system.

              We travel from Los Angeles to the Theo Lacy Facility in Orange, clear security screening,
              and meet with the inmate in the designated professional visiting area. The inmate confirms
              their identity, signs the documents in our presence, and we complete the notarization.
            </p>

            <h3>5. Document delivery</h3>
            <p>
              After the appointment, we return the signed and notarized documents to you, your attorney,
              escrow company, or other designated recipient &#8212; by hand delivery, courier, or mail
              depending on your timeline.

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Where is the Theo Lacy Facility?</h3>
        <p>
          The Theo Lacy Facility is located at 501 The City Drive South, Orange, CA 92868, between
          the Santa Ana Freeway (I-5) and the Garden Grove Freeway (SR-22). Parking is available at

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>How many inmates does Theo Lacy hold?</h3>
        <p>
          Theo Lacy is a maximum-security facility with a capacity of approximately 3,100 to 3,400
          inmates. It houses both sentenced and pre-sentenced male inmates arrested for misdemeanors
          and felonies.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>How do I find out if someone is at Theo Lacy?</h3>
        <p>
          You can search the Orange County Sheriff&#39;s Department inmate locator online or call
          the facility at (714) 935&#8209;6940 with the inmate&#39;s name and date of birth.

          The facility maintains booking records with photos that can be used for identification. If
