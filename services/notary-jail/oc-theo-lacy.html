          <div class="faq-item" style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6;">
            <h3>1. Contact us with the inmate’s information</h3>
            <p>
              Call or text with the inmate’s full legal name, booking number (if known), and a description
              of the documents that need to be notarized. Let us know your deadline so we can prioritize
              scheduling.
            </p>

            <h3>2. We coordinate with Theo Lacy</h3>
            <p>
              The Theo Lacy Facility has specific procedures for professional visits. We confirm the current
              visiting schedule, any advance requirements, and ensure the inmate is available and housed at
              Theo Lacy.
            </p>

            <h3>3. Prepare your documents</h3>
            <p>
              Have all documents ready and complete before the appointment — we cannot draft legal documents,
              only notarize signatures. If the inmate needs to review documents first, coordinate with their
              attorney or use the facility’s mail system.
            </p>

            <h3>4. The notary appointment in Orange</h3>
            <p>
              We travel from Los Angeles to the Theo Lacy Facility in Orange, clear security screening, and
              meet with the inmate in the designated professional visiting area. The inmate confirms their
              identity, signs the documents in our presence, and we complete the notarization with the
              appropriate certificate.
            </p>

            <h3>5. Document delivery</h3>
            <p>
              After the appointment, we return the signed and notarized documents to you, your attorney,
              escrow company, or other designated recipient — by hand delivery, courier, or mail depending
              on your timeline.

        Tip: Theo Lacy is a busy facility with thousands of inmates. Professional visit scheduling can fill

    <div class="service-detail-inner">
      <div class="service-detail-kicker">Common Questions</div>
      <h2>Theo Lacy Facility Notary FAQs</h2>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Where is the Theo Lacy Facility located?</h3>
        <p>
          The Theo Lacy Facility is located at 501 The City Drive South, Orange, CA 92868, between the Santa
          Ana Freeway (I‑5) and the Garden Grove Freeway (SR‑22). Parking is available at the North parking
          structure across from the Lamoreaux Justice Center.
        </p>

        <h3>What type of inmates are housed at Theo Lacy?</h3>
        <p>
          Theo Lacy is a maximum‑security facility with a capacity of approximately 3,100 to 3,400 inmates.
          It houses both sentenced and pre‑sentenced male inmates arrested for misdemeanors and felonies.
        </p>

        <h3>How do I confirm someone is at Theo Lacy?</h3>
        <p>
          You can search the Orange County Sheriff’s Department inmate locator online or call the facility
          at (714) 935‑6940 with the inmate’s name and date of birth to confirm they are housed at Theo Lacy.
        </p>

        <h3>What ID does the inmate need for notarization?</h3>
        <p>
          The facility maintains booking records with photos that can be used for identification. If the
          inmate has a valid California ID, driver’s license, or passport on file, that can also be used.
          We confirm ID options before the appointment.
        </p>

        <h3>Are professional visits different from regular visiting hours?</h3>
        <p>
          Yes. Professional visitors such as attorneys and notaries typically have broader access than public
          visitors, who are limited to Friday through Monday. We confirm the current professional visiting
          schedule with the facility before each appointment.
        </p>

        <h3>How long does a notary appointment at Theo Lacy take?</h3>
        <p>
          Plan for 1 to 3 hours total including travel from Los Angeles, security screening, wait time, and
          the signing. The notarization itself is quick, but facility procedures and travel add time.
