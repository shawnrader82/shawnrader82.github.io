      <div class="service-detail-grid">
        <div>
          <p class="service-detail-lead">
            The Central Detention Center (CDC) is located at 630 East Rialto Avenue in downtown
            San Bernardino and is operated by the San Bernardino County Sheriff&#39;s Department.
            CDC serves primarily as a booking and short-term housing facility for the county. Inmates
            booked at CDC may be transferred to other San Bernardino County facilities such as West
            Valley Detention Center or Glen Helen Rehabilitation Center after initial processing and
            classification.
          </p>
          <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-top:10px;">
            Because CDC is a booking-focused facility, timing is critical for notary appointments.
            Inmates may only be housed here for a short period before transfer. Contact us as soon
            as possible if you need documents notarized for someone at CDC.

            <h3>1. Contact us with the inmate&#39;s information</h3>
            <p>
              Call or text with the inmate&#39;s full legal name, booking number (if known), and a
              description of the documents that need to be notarized. Let us know your deadline so
              we can prioritize scheduling.
            </p>

            <h3>2. We coordinate with the facility</h3>
            <p>
              San Bernardino County facilities require visits to be scheduled at least one day in
              advance. Since CDC is primarily a booking and short-term housing facility, we confirm
              the inmate is still housed here before scheduling. Transfers to other facilities happen
              frequently.
            </p>

            <h3>3. Prepare your documents</h3>
            <p>
              Have all documents ready and complete before the appointment &#8212; we cannot draft legal
              documents, only notarize signatures. If the inmate needs to review documents first,
              coordinate with their attorney or use the facility&#39;s mail system.

              We travel from Los Angeles to CDC in San Bernardino, clear security screening, and meet
              with the inmate in the designated visiting area. The inmate confirms their identity,
              signs the documents in our presence, and we complete the notarization.

            <h3>5. Document delivery</h3>

              After the appointment, we return the signed and notarized documents to you, your attorney,
              escrow company, or other designated recipient &#8212; by hand delivery, courier, or mail
              depending on your timeline.

        <h3>What ID does the inmate need for notarization?</h3>
        <p>
          The facility maintains booking records with photos that can be used for identification. If
          the inmate has a valid California ID, driver&#39;s license, or passport on file, that can
          also be used. We confirm ID options before the appointment.

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>How long does a notary appointment at CDC take?</h3>
        <p>
          Plan for 2.5 to 3.5 hours total including travel from Los Angeles to downtown San Bernardino,
          security screening, wait time, and the signing. The notarization itself is quick, but travel
          and facility procedures add time.
