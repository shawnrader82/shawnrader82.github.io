      <h2>About Central Detention Center</h2>
      <p>The Central Detention Center (CDC) is located at 630 East Rialto Avenue in downtown San Bernardino and is operated by the San Bernardino County Sheriff&#39;s Department. CDC serves primarily as a booking and short-term housing facility for the county. Inmates booked at CDC may be transferred to other San Bernardino County facilities such as West Valley Detention Center or Glen Helen Rehabilitation Center after initial processing and classification.</p>
      <p>Because CDC is a booking-focused facility, timing is critical for notary appointments. Inmates may only be housed here for a short period before transfer. Contact us as soon as possible if you need documents notarized for someone at CDC.</p>

    <div class="container">
      <h2>Scheduling a Notary Appointment at CDC</h2>
      <ol class="steps-list">
        <li>
          <h3>Contact us with the inmate&#39;s information</h3>
          <p>Call or text with the inmate&#39;s full legal name, booking number (if known), and a description of the documents that need to be notarized. Let us know your deadline so we can prioritize scheduling.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>We coordinate with the facility</h3>
          <p>San Bernardino County facilities require visits to be scheduled at least one day in advance. Since CDC is primarily a booking and short-term housing facility, we confirm the inmate is still housed here before scheduling. Transfers to other facilities happen frequently.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Prepare your documents</h3>
          <p>Have all documents ready and complete before the appointment &mdash; we cannot draft legal documents, only notarize signatures. If the inmate needs to review documents first, coordinate with their attorney or use the facility&#39;s mail system.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>The notary appointment</h3>
          <p>We travel from Los Angeles to CDC in San Bernardino, clear security screening, and meet with the inmate in the designated visiting area. The inmate confirms their identity, signs the documents in our presence, and we complete the notarization.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Document delivery</h3>
          <p>After the appointment, we return the signed and notarized documents to you, your attorney, escrow company, or other designated recipient &mdash; by hand delivery, courier, or mail depending on your timeline.</p>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p class="tip"><strong>Tip:</strong> CDC is primarily a booking and short-term housing facility. Inmates may be transferred to West Valley, Glen Helen, or High Desert within days of booking. Confirm the inmate&#39;s location close to the appointment time to avoid a wasted trip.</p>
