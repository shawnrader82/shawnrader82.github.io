      <h2>About the Central Detention Center (CDC)</h2>

      <div class="service-detail-grid">
        <div>
          <p class="service-detail-lead">
            The Central Detention Center (CDC) is located at 630 East Rialto Avenue in downtown
            San Bernardino and is operated by the San Bernardino County Sheriff’s Department. CDC serves
            primarily as a booking and short‑term housing facility. Inmates booked at CDC may be transferred
            to other county facilities such as West Valley Detention Center or Glen Helen Rehabilitation
            Center after initial processing and classification.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Address:</strong> 630 E Rialto Ave, San Bernardino, CA 92415</li>
            <li><strong>Operated by:</strong> San Bernardino County Sheriff’s Department</li>
            <li><strong>Primary role:</strong> Booking and short‑term housing</li>
            <li><strong>Transfer facilities:</strong> West Valley, Glen Helen, High Desert Detention Center</li>
            <li><strong>Approximate distance from Los Angeles:</strong> 60–75 minutes by car</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3>Why timing matters at CDC</h3>
          <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6;">
            Because CDC is a booking‑focused facility, inmates may only be housed here for a short period
            before transfer. If you need a document notarized while someone is at CDC, it is important to
            act quickly to schedule the visit before they are moved to another jail.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Short stay:</strong> Many inmates are transferred within days of booking.</li>
            <li><strong>Frequent movement:</strong> Location must be confirmed close to the appointment time.</li>
            <li><strong>Action:</strong> Contact us as soon as possible to minimize the risk of a missed window.</li>

          <div class="faq-item" style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6;">
            <h3>1. Contact us with the inmate’s information</h3>
            <p>
              Call or text with the inmate’s full legal name, booking number (if known), and a description
              of the documents that need to be notarized. Let us know your deadline so we can prioritize
              scheduling.
            </p>

            <h3>2. We confirm housing and visiting rules</h3>
            <p>
              San Bernardino County facilities require visits to be scheduled at least one day in advance.
              Because CDC is primarily a booking and short‑term housing facility, we confirm that the inmate
              is still housed here and has not been transferred before we schedule the appointment.
            </p>

            <h3>3. Prepare your documents</h3>
            <p>
              Have all documents ready and complete before the appointment — we cannot draft legal documents,
              only notarize signatures. If the inmate needs to review documents first, coordinate with their
              attorney or use the facility’s mail system.

              We travel from Los Angeles to CDC in San Bernardino, clear security screening, and meet with
              the inmate in the designated visiting area. The inmate confirms their identity, signs the
              documents in our presence, and we complete the notarization with the appropriate certificate.
            </p>

            <h3>5. Document delivery</h3>
            <p>
              After the appointment, we return the signed and notarized documents to you, your attorney,
              escrow company, or other designated recipient — by hand delivery, courier, or mail depending
              on your timeline.

    <div class="service-detail-inner">
      <div class="service-detail-kicker">Common Questions</div>
      <h2>Central Detention Center Notary FAQs (San Bernardino)</h2>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Where is the Central Detention Center located?</h3>
        <p>
          CDC is located at 630 E Rialto Ave, San Bernardino, CA 92415, in downtown San Bernardino. It is
          approximately 60 to 75 minutes from Los Angeles, depending on traffic.
        </p>

        <h3>What is CDC’s role within San Bernardino County jails?</h3>
        <p>
          The Central Detention Center serves primarily as a booking and short‑term housing facility. Inmates
          booked at CDC may be transferred to West Valley Detention Center, Glen Helen Rehabilitation Center,
          or High Desert Detention Center after initial processing and classification.
        </p>

        <h3>How do I confirm someone is at CDC?</h3>
        <p>
          You can search the San Bernardino County Sheriff’s inmate locator online or call
          (909) 386‑0969 with the inmate’s name and date of birth to confirm they are housed at
          Central Detention Center.
        </p>

        <h3>What are the public visiting hours at CDC?</h3>
        <p>
          Public visiting hours are Wednesday through Saturday, 8:30 AM to 7:00 PM, by appointment only.
          Visits must be scheduled at least one day in advance by calling (909) 887‑0364 or scheduling
          online. Attorneys and bail bond agents may visit any day of the week.
        </p>

        <h3>How is the inmate’s identity verified for notarization?</h3>
        <p>
          The facility maintains booking records with photos that can be used for identification. If the
          inmate has a valid California ID, driver’s license, or passport on file, that can also be used.
          We confirm ID options with the facility before the appointment.
        </p>

        <h3>How long should I plan for a CDC notary appointment?</h3>
        <p>
          Plan for 2.5 to 3.5 hours total including travel from Los Angeles to downtown San Bernardino,
          security screening, wait time, and the signing. The notarization itself is quick, but travel and
          facility procedures add time.
