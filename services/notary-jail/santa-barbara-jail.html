  <!-- ========== HOW IT WORKS ========== -->
  <section class="service-detail-section">
    <div class="container">
      <h2>Scheduling a Notary Appointment at Santa Barbara County Jail</h2>
      <ol class="steps-list">
        <li>
          <h3>Share the inmate’s information and documents</h3>
          <p>Call or text with the inmate’s full legal name, booking or CID number (if available), and a description of the documents to be notarized. Let us know whether the inmate is housed at the Main Jail on Calle Real, the Northern Branch Jail in Santa Maria, or another Santa Barbara County facility.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>We coordinate with custody staff</h3>
          <p>We contact the appropriate facility (Main Jail or Northern Branch) to confirm housing location, current visiting procedures, and how professional visits are handled. For Northern Branch visits, we work within the ViaPath scheduling framework and coordinate with the watch commander or designated staff to arrange the notary visit.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Prepare your documents</h3>
          <p>Have all documents complete and ready before the appointment. We cannot draft legal documents or provide legal advice; our role is to verify identity, witness signatures, and complete the notarization. If the inmate needs to review documents ahead of time, coordinate with their attorney or send copies through the jail’s mail or email systems.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>The notary appointment at the jail</h3>
          <p>On the day of the appointment, we meet you outside the facility or proceed directly to the designated lobby, check in with custody staff, and are escorted to a non-contact visiting area. The inmate confirms their identity, we verify ID based on jail records or approved ID on file, and the inmate signs in our presence. We then complete the notarial certificate.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Returning the signed and notarized documents</h3>
          <p>After the visit, we return the originals to you, your attorney, a title or escrow company, or any other designated recipient. Depending on your deadlines, we can hand-deliver locally, overnight by courier, or return by mail.</p>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p class="tip"><strong>Tip:</strong> Santa Barbara County requires visitors to be on the inmate’s approved visitor list and to check in early for each visit. If you plan to attend the appointment in person, make sure you’re on the list and bring valid government-issued photo ID.</p>
