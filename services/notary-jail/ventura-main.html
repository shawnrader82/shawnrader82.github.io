      <h2>Scheduling a Notary Appointment at Ventura Main Jail</h2>
      <ol class="steps-list">
        <li>
          <h3>Contact us with the inmate&#39;s information</h3>
          <p>Call or text with the inmate&#39;s full legal name, booking number (if known), and a description of the documents that need to be notarized. Let us know your deadline so we can prioritize scheduling.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>We coordinate with the facility</h3>
          <p>Ventura County facilities have specific visiting sessions by housing unit on Wednesday, Thursday, Saturday, and Sunday. We contact the Main Jail at (805) 654-3335 to confirm the inmate&#39;s availability and coordinate a professional visit. We verify the inmate is housed at the Main Jail and not Todd Road before making the trip.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Prepare your documents</h3>
          <p>Have all documents ready and complete before the appointment &mdash; we cannot draft legal documents, only notarize signatures. If the inmate needs to review documents first, coordinate with their attorney or use the facility&#39;s mail system.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>The notary appointment</h3>
          <p>We travel from Los Angeles to the Ventura County Main Jail (approximately 65 minutes via US-101), clear security screening, and meet with the inmate in the designated visiting area. All visitors are subject to search. No cell phones, wallets, or personal items are allowed in the visiting area. The inmate confirms their identity, signs the documents in our presence, and we complete the notarization.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Document delivery</h3>
          <p>After the appointment, we return the signed and notarized documents to you, your attorney, escrow company, or other designated recipient &mdash; by hand delivery, courier, or mail depending on your timeline.</p>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p class="tip"><strong>Tip:</strong> The Main Jail primarily houses pre-trial detainees. If the inmate has already been sentenced, they may have been transferred to Todd Road Jail in Santa Paula. Call us and we&#39;ll confirm the correct facility before scheduling. Check-in at the Public Reception Lobby opens 1 hour before each session and closes 30 minutes before the session ends &mdash; arriving late means the visit is denied.</p>
