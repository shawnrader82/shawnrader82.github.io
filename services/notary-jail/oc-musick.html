            <h3>1. Contact us with the inmate&#39;s information</h3>
            <p>
              Call or text with the inmate&#39;s full legal name, booking number (if known), and a
              description of the documents that need to be notarized. Let us know your deadline so
              we can prioritize scheduling.
            </p>

            <h3>2. We coordinate with Musick</h3>
            <p>
              We confirm current visiting procedures, professional visit scheduling, and ensure the
              inmate is available and housed at the Musick Facility (not temporarily transferred for
              court or medical reasons).
            </p>

            <h3>3. Prepare your documents</h3>
            <p>
              Have all documents ready and complete before the appointment &#8212; we cannot draft legal
              documents, only notarize signatures. If the inmate needs to review documents first,
              coordinate with their attorney or use the facility&#39;s mail system.

              staff, and meet with the inmate. The inmate confirms their identity, signs the documents
              in our presence, and we complete the notarization.
            </p>

            <h3>5. Document delivery</h3>

              After the appointment, we return the signed and notarized documents to you, your attorney,
              escrow company, or other designated recipient &#8212; by hand delivery, courier, or mail
              depending on your timeline.

      <h2>Musick Facility Notary FAQs</h2>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Where is the James A. Musick Facility?</h3>
        <p>
          The Musick Facility is located at 13502 Musick Road, Irvine, CA 92618, in south Orange
          County near the junction of the I-5 and I-405 freeways.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>What kind of inmates are housed at Musick?</h3>
        <p>
          Musick primarily houses low-risk inmates, including those convicted of minor offenses and
          non-violent misdemeanors. It houses both male and female inmates and has a capacity of
          approximately 1,250 beds.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>How do I find out if someone is at the Musick Facility?</h3>
        <p>
          You can search the Orange County Sheriff&#39;s Department inmate locator online or call
          the facility at (949) 855&#8209;2600 with the inmate&#39;s name and date of birth.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>What ID does the inmate need for notarization?</h3>
        <p>
          The facility maintains booking records with photos that can be used for identification.
          Acceptable government-issued IDs include a California driver&#39;s license, California ID
          card, U.S. passport, alien registration card, or military ID.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Is visiting at Musick different from other OC jails?</h3>
        <p>
          Yes. Musick is a minimum-security facility, so the visiting environment is generally more
          relaxed than at maximum-security jails. Visits take place at benches rather than behind glass.
          Attorneys and other professional visitors can visit 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>How long does a notary appointment at Musick take?</h3>
        <p>
          Plan for 2 to 3 hours total including travel from Los Angeles to south Irvine, check-in,
          wait time, and the signing. The notarization itself is quick, but the distance from LA adds
          significant travel time.
        </p>
