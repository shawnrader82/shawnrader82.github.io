            <p class="faq-question">1. Contact us with the inmate&#8217;s information</p>
            <p class="faq-answer">
              Call or text with the inmate&#8217;s full legal name, Bureau of Prisons register number (if known),
              and a description of the documents that need to be notarized. Let us know any federal
              court deadlines or time-sensitive issues.
            </p>

            <p class="faq-question">2. We confirm MDC procedures</p>
            <p class="faq-answer">
              Federal Bureau of Prisons facilities have their own rules for professional visits. We confirm
              MDC Los Angeles procedures for notary visits, including identification requirements, scheduling
              windows, and where professional visitors check in.

            <p class="faq-question">3. Prepare your documents</p>
            <p class="faq-answer">
              Have all documents ready and complete before the appointment &#8212; we cannot draft legal documents,
              only notarize signatures. If the inmate needs to review documents first, coordinate with
              their attorney or mail the documents to MDC in advance following BOP mail rules.

            <p class="faq-answer">
              We travel to MDC Los Angeles, clear federal security, and meet with the inmate in the
              designated attorney or professional visiting area. The inmate confirms their identity,
              signs the documents in our presence, and we complete the notarization with the appropriate
              certificate.

      <h2>MDC Los Angeles Notary FAQs</h2>

      <div class="faq-block">
        <p class="faq-question">Is MDC Los Angeles the same as Twin Towers or Men&#8217;s Central Jail?</p>
        <p class="faq-answer">
          No. Metropolitan Detention Center Los Angeles is a federal Bureau of Prisons facility that
          holds federal inmates, while Twin Towers and Men&#8217;s Central Jail are Los Angeles County jails.
          If you are not sure which facility the person is in, we can help you check before scheduling.
        </p>

        <p class="faq-question">How do I confirm someone is at MDC Los Angeles?</p>
        <p class="faq-answer">
          You can search the Federal Bureau of Prisons inmate locator at
          <a href="https://www.bop.gov/inmateloc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bop.gov/inmateloc</a>
          using the inmate&#8217;s name or register number. The system will show "MDC Los Angeles" if that is
          their current location. You can also contact the facility directly at (213) 485&#8209;0439.
        </p>

        <p class="faq-question">Can you work with out-of-state attorneys or consulates?</p>
        <p class="faq-answer">
          Yes. Many MDC appointments involve federal defense attorneys from other states or consular
          officials. We coordinate timing, document preparation, and delivery so that signatures at MDC
          meet the requirements of courts, agencies, or consulates.
        </p>

        <p class="faq-question">Do you notarize documents for immigration cases at MDC?</p>
        <p class="faq-answer">
          We can notarize affidavits, declarations, and other documents related to immigration matters
          when a notary is permitted. We cannot give immigration or legal advice, but we work closely
          with your immigration attorney or representative to ensure documents are ready to sign.
        </p>

        <p class="faq-question">What ID does the inmate need for notarization?</p>
        <p class="faq-answer">
          MDC Los Angeles maintains federal booking records with photos and identification information
          that can be used for identification. If the inmate has a valid passport or other government&#8209;issued
          ID on file, that may also be used. We confirm acceptable ID options with the facility before
          the appointment.
        </p>

        <p class="faq-question">What if the inmate is moved to another federal facility?</p>
        <p class="faq-answer">
          Federal inmates may be transferred between MDC Los Angeles and other BOP facilities. We
          recommend confirming the inmate&#8217;s location close to the appointment time. If they have been
          moved, we can discuss options based on the new facility and your timeline.
