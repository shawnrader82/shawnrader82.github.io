      <h2>Scheduling a Notary Appointment at High Desert Detention Center</h2>

      <div class="service-detail-grid">
        <div>
          <div class="faq-item" style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6;">
            <h3>1. Contact us with the inmate’s information</h3>
            <p>
              Call or text with the inmate’s full legal name, booking number (if known), and a description
              of the documents that need to be notarized. Let us know any upcoming court dates or deadlines
              so we can prioritize scheduling. [file:285]
            </p>

            <h3>2. We coordinate with the facility</h3>
            <p>
              High Desert Detention Center has specific procedures for professional visits that differ from
              public visiting hours. Because Adelanto is remote, we confirm scheduling, any advance approvals,
              and make sure the inmate will be available at the appointment time before we travel. [file:285]
            </p>

            <h3>3. Prepare your documents</h3>
            <p>
              Have all documents ready and complete before the appointment — we cannot draft legal documents,
              only notarize signatures. If the inmate needs to review documents first, coordinate with their
              attorney or mail documents to the facility in advance. [file:285]
            </p>
          </div>

            <h3>4. The notary appointment in Adelanto</h3>
            <p>
              We travel from the Los Angeles area to Adelanto, clear security screening at High Desert
              Detention Center, and meet with the inmate in the designated professional visiting area. The
              inmate confirms their identity, signs the documents in our presence, and we complete the
              notarization. [file:285]
            </p>

            <h3>5. Document delivery</h3>
            <p>
              After the appointment, we return the signed and notarized documents to you, your attorney,
              escrow company, or other designated recipient — by hand delivery, courier, or mail depending
              on your timeline. [file:285]

      <h2>High Desert Detention Center Notary FAQs</h2>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Where is High Desert Detention Center?</h3>
        <p>
          High Desert Detention Center is located at 9438 Commerce Way, Adelanto, CA 92301, in the High
          Desert region of San Bernardino County. [file:285]
        </p>

        <h3>How do I find out if someone is at High Desert Detention Center?</h3>
        <p>
          You can search the San Bernardino County Sheriff inmate locator online or call the facility with
          the person’s name and date of birth for inmate information. [file:285]
        </p>

        <h3>Do you notarize documents at other San Bernardino County jails?</h3>
        <p>
          Yes. In addition to High Desert Detention Center, we visit West Valley Detention Center, Glen
          Helen Rehabilitation Center, and Central Detention Center for mobile notary appointments. [file:285]
        </p>

        <h3>What ID does the inmate need for notarization?</h3>
        <p>
          The jail maintains booking records with photos that can be used for identification. If the inmate
          has a valid California ID, driver’s license, or passport on file, that can also be used. We confirm
          ID options before the appointment. [file:285]
        </p>

        <h3>How long does a notary appointment at High Desert Detention Center take?</h3>
        <p>
          Plan for 2 to 4 hours total including travel to Adelanto, security screening, wait time, and the
          signing itself. The notarization is quick, but the remote location and jail procedures add time.
          [file:285]
        </p>

        <h3>What if the inmate was just booked or is being transferred?</h3>
        <p>
          Newly booked inmates may not be available for professional visits until processing is complete. If
          the inmate is being transferred between San Bernardino County facilities, we recommend confirming
          their location close to the appointment time. [file:285]
