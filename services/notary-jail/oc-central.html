        <div>
          <p class="service-detail-lead">
            The James A. Musick Facility — sometimes called “The Farm” — is a minimum‑security jail in Irvine
            operated by the Orange County Sheriff’s Department. With approximately 1,250 beds, it houses both
            male and female inmates who are typically low‑risk individuals convicted of minor offenses and
            non‑violent misdemeanors, as well as some inmates awaiting arraignment.
          </p>

          <h3>Why inmates at Musick need notary services</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Short‑ to medium‑term custody</strong> — Inmates often need to manage life outside while serving time on lower‑level offenses.</li>
            <li><strong>Property and vehicle matters</strong> — Signing deeds, titles, and other documents so family can sell or manage homes and vehicles.</li>
            <li><strong>Family and financial planning</strong> — Powers of attorney and authorizations so trusted relatives can handle banking and bills.</li>
            <li><strong>Court and legal paperwork</strong> — Declarations, affidavits, and other documents needed for active cases or probation matters.</li>

            <h3>1. Contact us with the inmate’s information</h3>
            <p>
              Call or text with the inmate’s full legal name, booking number (if known), and a description
              of the documents that need to be notarized. Let us know your deadline so we can prioritize
              scheduling.
            </p>

            <h3>2. We confirm Musick procedures</h3>
            <p>
              We confirm current visiting procedures, professional visit scheduling, and ensure the inmate
              is available and housed at the Musick Facility (not temporarily transferred for court or
              medical reasons).
            </p>

            <h3>3. Prepare your documents</h3>
            <p>
              Have all documents ready and complete before the appointment — we cannot draft legal documents,
              only notarize signatures. If the inmate needs to review documents first, coordinate with their
              attorney or use the facility’s mail system.

              We travel from Los Angeles to the Musick Facility in Irvine, check in with facility staff, and
              meet with the inmate. The inmate confirms their identity, signs the documents in our presence,
              and we complete the notarization with the appropriate certificate.
            </p>

            <h3>5. Document delivery</h3>
            <p>
              After the appointment, we return the signed and notarized documents to you, your attorney,
              escrow company, or other designated recipient — by hand delivery, courier, or mail depending
              on your timeline.

  <section class="service-detail service-detail--gray" id="musick-notary-faq">
    <div class="service-detail-inner">
      <div class="service-detail-kicker">Common Questions</div>
      <h2>James A. Musick Facility Notary FAQs</h2>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Where is the James A. Musick Facility located?</h3>
        <p>
          The Musick Facility is located at 13502 Musick Road, Irvine, CA 92618, in south Orange County
          near the junction of the I‑5 and I‑405 freeways.
        </p>

        <h3>What type of inmates are housed at Musick?</h3>
        <p>
          Musick primarily houses low‑risk inmates, including those convicted of minor offenses and
          non‑violent misdemeanors. It houses both male and female inmates and has a capacity of
          approximately 1,250 beds.
        </p>

        <h3>How do I confirm someone is at the Musick Facility?</h3>
        <p>
          You can search the Orange County Sheriff’s Department inmate locator online or call the facility
          at (949) 855‑2600 with the inmate’s name and date of birth to confirm they are housed at Musick.
        </p>

        <h3>What ID does the inmate need for notarization?</h3>
        <p>
          The facility maintains booking records with photos that can be used for identification. Acceptable
          government‑issued IDs include a California driver’s license, California ID card, U.S. passport,
          alien registration card, or military ID, when available in the inmate’s records.
        </p>

        <h3>Is the visiting environment different from other jails?</h3>
        <p>
          Yes. Musick is a minimum‑security facility, so the visiting environment is generally more relaxed
          than at maximum‑security jails. Visits may take place at benches rather than behind glass, and
          professional visitors often have more flexible access.
        </p>

        <h3>How long should I plan for a Musick notary appointment?</h3>
        <p>
          Plan for 2 to 3 hours total including travel from Los Angeles to south Irvine, check‑in, wait time,
          and the signing. The notarization itself is quick, but the distance from LA adds significant travel
          time.
