            <h3>1. Contact us with the inmate&#8217;s information</h3>
            <p>
              Call or text with the inmate&#8217;s full legal name, booking number (if known), and a description
              of the documents that need to be notarized. Let us know whether the inmate is in the Central
              Men&#39;s Jail, Central Women&#39;s Jail, or the IRC, and share any court deadlines.
            </p>

            <h3 style="margin-top:12px;">2. We coordinate with the facility</h3>
            <p>
              The OC Central Jail Complex has specific procedures for professional visits that differ from public
              visiting hours. We confirm scheduling, any advance requirements, and ensure the inmate is available
              and currently housed at the facility.
            </p>

            <h3 style="margin-top:12px;">3. Prepare your documents</h3>
            <p>
              Have all documents ready and complete before the appointment &mdash; we cannot draft legal documents,
              only notarize signatures. If the inmate needs to review documents first, coordinate with their attorney
              or mail documents to the facility in advance.

            <h3>4. The notary appointment in Santa Ana</h3>
            <p>
              We travel from Los Angeles to the Central Jail Complex in Santa Ana, clear security screening, and meet
              with the inmate in the designated professional visiting area. The inmate confirms their identity, signs
              the documents in our presence, and we complete the notarization with the appropriate certificate.
            </p>

            <h3 style="margin-top:12px;">5. Document delivery</h3>
            <p>
              After the appointment, we return the signed and notarized documents to you, your attorney, escrow company,
              or other designated recipient &mdash; by hand delivery, courier, or mail depending on your timeline.
