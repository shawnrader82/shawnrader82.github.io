      <h2>Scheduling a Notary Appointment at MDC Los Angeles</h2>

      <div class="service-detail-grid">
        <div>
          <div class="faq-item" style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6;">
            <h3>1. Contact us with the inmate&#8217;s information</h3>
            <p>
              Call or text with the inmate&#8217;s full legal name, Bureau of Prisons register number,
              and a description of the documents that need to be notarized. Let us know any federal
              court deadlines or time-sensitive issues.
            </p>

            <h3>2. Attorney coordination</h3>
            <p>
              Because MDC Los Angeles is a federal facility, notary visits typically require sponsorship
              or coordination through the inmate&#8217;s attorney. Unlike county jails, we cannot simply
              walk in and request a visit. We will work with you and the legal team to complete the
              required Bureau of Prisons approval steps before the appointment.
            </p>

            <h3>3. Prepare your documents</h3>
            <p>
              Have all documents ready and complete before the appointment &#8212; we cannot draft legal documents,
              only notarize signatures. If the inmate needs to review documents first, coordinate with
              their attorney or send documents to MDC in advance following BOP mail procedures.
            </p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div>
          <div class="faq-item" style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6;">
            <h3>4. BOP approval and scheduling</h3>
            <p>
              Federal facilities require prior approval for professional visitors, which can take
              several business days. We handle the paperwork and coordination, but please plan ahead &#8212;
              MDC appointments cannot typically be arranged on the same day or next day like some
              county jail visits.
            </p>

            <h3>5. The notary appointment at MDC</h3>
            <p>
              Once approved, we travel to MDC Los Angeles, clear federal security, and meet with the
              inmate in the designated visiting area. The inmate confirms their identity, signs the
              documents in our presence, and we complete the notarization.
            </p>

            <h3>6. Document delivery</h3>
            <p>
              After the appointment, we return the signed and notarized documents to you, your attorney,
              the federal court, or another designated recipient &#8212; by hand delivery in the LA area,
              courier, or mail depending on your timeline.

      <h2>MDC Los Angeles Notary FAQs</h2>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Is MDC Los Angeles the same as Twin Towers or Men&#8217;s Central Jail?</h3>
        <p>
          No. Metropolitan Detention Center Los Angeles is a federal Bureau of Prisons facility that
          holds federal inmates, while Twin Towers and Men&#8217;s Central Jail are Los Angeles County jails.
          If you are not sure which facility the person is in, we can help you check before scheduling.
        </p>

        <h3>Is the process the same as visiting a county jail?</h3>
        <p>
          No. MDC Los Angeles is a federal Bureau of Prisons facility with a separate and more involved
          approval process for professional visitors like notaries. County jails typically allow faster
          scheduling, while federal facilities require advance paperwork, attorney involvement, and
          approval that can take several business days. Plan for extra lead time when scheduling.
        </p>

        <h3>Does the inmate&#8217;s attorney need to be involved?</h3>
        <p>
          In most cases, yes. Federal facilities generally require that notary visits be coordinated
          through or sponsored by the inmate&#8217;s attorney of record. When you contact us, we will
          explain exactly what is needed and can coordinate directly with the legal team.
        </p>

        <h3>How far in advance should I schedule?</h3>
        <p>
          We recommend contacting us at least one week before your deadline, and earlier if possible.
          The federal approval process takes several business days, and scheduling around MDC visiting
          procedures adds additional time compared to county facilities.
        </p>

        <h3>How do I confirm someone is at MDC Los Angeles?</h3>
        <p>
          You can search the Federal Bureau of Prisons inmate locator at
          <a href="https://www.bop.gov/inmateloc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bop.gov/inmateloc</a>
          using the inmate&#8217;s name or register number. The system will show &#8220;MDC Los Angeles&#8221; if that is
          their current location. You can also contact the facility directly at (213) 485&#8209;0439.
        </p>

        <h3>Can you work with out-of-state attorneys or consulates?</h3>
        <p>
          Yes. Many MDC appointments involve federal defense attorneys from other states or consular
          officials. We coordinate timing, document preparation, and delivery so that signatures at MDC
          meet the requirements of courts, agencies, or consulates.
        </p>

        <h3>Do you notarize documents for immigration cases at MDC?</h3>
        <p>
          We can notarize affidavits, declarations, and other documents related to immigration matters
          when a notary is permitted. We cannot give immigration or legal advice, but we work closely
          with your immigration attorney or representative to ensure documents are ready to sign.
        </p>

        <h3>What ID does the inmate need for notarization?</h3>
        <p>
          MDC Los Angeles maintains federal booking records with photos and identification information
          that can be used for identification. If the inmate has a valid passport or other government&#8209;issued
          ID on file, that may also be used. We confirm acceptable ID options with the facility before
          the appointment.
        </p>

        <h3>What if the inmate is moved to another federal facility?</h3>
        <p>
          Federal inmates may be transferred between MDC Los Angeles and other BOP facilities. We
          recommend confirming the inmate&#8217;s location close to the appointment time. If they have been
          moved, we can discuss options based on the new facility and your timeline.
