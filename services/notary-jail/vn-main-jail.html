          <div class="faq-item" style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6;">
            <h3>1. Contact us with the inmate&#39;s information</h3>
            <p>
              Call or text with the inmate&#39;s full legal name, booking number (if known), and a
              description of the documents that need to be notarized. Let us know your deadline so
              we can prioritize scheduling.
            </p>

            <h3>2. We coordinate with the facility</h3>
            <p>
              Ventura County facilities have specific visiting sessions by housing unit on Wednesday,
              Thursday, Saturday, and Sunday. We contact the Main Jail at (805) 654&#8209;3335 to
              confirm the inmate&#39;s availability and coordinate a professional visit. We verify
              the inmate is housed at the Main Jail and not Todd Road before making the trip.
            </p>

            <h3>3. Prepare your documents</h3>
            <p>
              Have all documents ready and complete before the appointment &#8212; we cannot draft legal
              documents, only notarize signatures. If the inmate needs to review documents first,
              coordinate with their attorney or use the facility&#39;s mail system.

            <h3>4. The notary appointment</h3>
            <p>
              We travel from Los Angeles to the Ventura County Main Jail (approximately 65 minutes via
              US-101), clear security screening, and meet with the inmate in the designated visiting
              area. All visitors are subject to search. No cell phones, wallets, or personal items are
              allowed in the visiting area. The inmate confirms their identity, signs the documents in
              our presence, and we complete the notarization.
            </p>

            <h3>5. Document delivery</h3>
            <p>
              After the appointment, we return the signed and notarized documents to you, your attorney,
              escrow company, or other designated recipient &#8212; by hand delivery, courier, or mail
              depending on your timeline.

        <h3>What is the difference between the Main Jail and Todd Road Jail?</h3>
        <p>
          The Main Jail (PTDF) in Ventura primarily houses pre-trial detainees and handles initial
          booking. Todd Road Jail in Santa Paula primarily houses sentenced inmates in longer-term
          custody. They are separate facilities with different addresses and visiting schedules.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>How long does a notary appointment at the Main Jail take?</h3>
        <p>
          Plan for 3 to 4 hours total including travel from Los Angeles (approximately 65 minutes each
          way via US-101), security screening, wait time, and the signing.
