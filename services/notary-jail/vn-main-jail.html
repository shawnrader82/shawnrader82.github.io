      <div class="service-detail-grid">
        <div>
          <p class="service-detail-lead">
            The Ventura County Main Jail, officially known as the Pre‑Trial Detention Facility (PTDF), is the
            county's primary booking and pre‑trial detention facility. Operated by the Ventura County Sheriff's
            Office, it houses inmates awaiting trial, sentencing, or transfer to other facilities.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Address:</strong> 800 S Victoria Ave, Ventura, CA 93009</li>
            <li><strong>Main phone:</strong> (805) 654‑3335</li>
            <li><strong>Operated by:</strong> Ventura County Sheriff’s Office</li>
            <li><strong>Capacity:</strong> Approximately 814 beds</li>
            <li><strong>Public reception lobby:</strong> 6:00 AM – 11:00 PM daily</li>
            <li><strong>Visiting days:</strong> Wednesday, Thursday, Saturday, Sunday</li>
            <li><strong>Visiting sessions:</strong> Morning 8:30 AM – 11:30 AM; Afternoon 1:30 PM – 4:30 PM; Evening 7:00 PM – 9:00 PM (assigned by housing unit)</li>
            <li><strong>Check‑in:</strong> Starts 1 hour before session; closes 30 minutes before session ends</li>
            <li><strong>Location:</strong> Approximately 65 minutes from Los Angeles via US‑101</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3>Why inmates at the Main Jail need notary services</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Active court cases</strong> — Declarations, affidavits, and other documents needed before hearings and trial dates.</li>
            <li><strong>Family and financial planning</strong> — Powers of attorney so trusted relatives can manage finances, property, and legal matters.</li>
            <li><strong>Real estate and business issues</strong> — Deeds, contracts, and business documents that cannot wait until after release.</li>
            <li><strong>Emergency situations</strong> — Time‑sensitive paperwork for family, custody, or medical decisions while the person is in custody.</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="service-detail-note" style="margin-top:12px;">
            The Main Jail primarily houses pre‑trial detainees. If the inmate has already been sentenced, they
            may have been transferred to Todd Road Jail in Santa Paula. We confirm the correct facility before
            scheduling any visit.

      <div class="service-detail-kicker">How it works</div>
      <h2>Scheduling a Notary Appointment at Ventura County Main Jail</h2>

      <div class="service-detail-grid">
        <div>
          <div class="faq-item" style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6;">
            <h3>1. Contact us with the inmate’s information</h3>
            <p>
              Call or text with the inmate’s full legal name, booking number (if known), and a description
              of the documents that need to be notarized. Let us know your deadline so we can prioritize
              scheduling.
            </p>

            <h3>2. We confirm Main Jail procedures</h3>
            <p>
              Ventura County facilities have specific visiting sessions by housing unit on Wednesday, Thursday,
              Saturday, and Sunday. We contact the Main Jail at (805) 654‑3335 to confirm the inmate’s availability
              and coordinate a professional visit, verifying that they are housed at the Main Jail and not Todd Road.
            </p>

            <h3>3. Prepare your documents</h3>
            <p>
              Have all documents ready and complete before the appointment — we cannot draft legal documents,
              only notarize signatures. If the inmate needs to review documents first, coordinate with their
              attorney or use the facility’s mail system.
            </p>

            <h3>4. The notary appointment in Ventura</h3>
            <p>
              We travel from Los Angeles to the Ventura County Main Jail (approximately 65 minutes via US‑101),
              clear security screening, and meet with the inmate in the designated visiting area. All visitors are
              subject to search, and no cell phones, wallets, or personal items are allowed in the visiting area.
              The inmate confirms their identity, signs the documents in our presence, and we complete the
              notarization.
            </p>

            <h3>5. Document delivery</h3>
            <p>
              After the appointment, we return the signed and notarized documents to you, your attorney,
              escrow company, or other designated recipient — by hand delivery, courier, or mail depending
              on your timeline.

        <p>
          You can search the Ventura County Sheriff’s inmate locator online or call (805) 654‑3335.
          Be sure to confirm whether the inmate is at the Main Jail or at Todd Road Jail in Santa Paula.
        </p>

        <h3>What are the visiting days and sessions at the Main Jail?</h3>
        <p>
          Visiting days are Wednesday, Thursday, Saturday, and Sunday. Sessions are typically
