              <strong>Medical and legal coordination</strong> &#8212; Many Twin Towers inmates have ongoing

              for medical decisions.

            <li>
              <strong>Pending court matters</strong> &#8212; Signing declarations, affidavits, and court
              filings before hearings or trial dates.

            <h3>1. Contact us with the inmate&#8217;s information</p>
            <p>
              Call or text with the inmate&#8217;s full legal name, booking number (if known), and a description
              of the documents that need to be notarized. Let us know your deadline so we can prioritize
              scheduling.
            </p>

            <h3>2. We coordinate with Twin Towers</p>
            <p>
              Twin Towers has specific procedures for professional visits. We confirm visiting hours,
              any advance scheduling requirements, and ensure the inmate is available (not in medical
              housing with restricted access or temporarily out for court).
            </p>

            <h3>3. Prepare your documents</p>
            <p>
              Have all documents ready and complete before the appointment &#8212; we cannot draft legal documents,
              only notarize signatures. If the inmate needs to review documents first, coordinate with their
              attorney or use the facility&#8217;s mail system.

              We arrive at Twin Towers, clear security screening, and meet with the inmate in the designated
              professional visiting area. The inmate confirms their identity, signs the documents in
              our presence, and we complete the notarization with the appropriate certificate.
            </p>

            <h3>5. Document delivery</p>

              escrow company, or other designated recipient &#8212; by hand delivery in the LA area, courier,

      <h2>Twin Towers Notary FAQs</h2>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>How is Twin Towers different from Men&#8217;s Central Jail?</p>
        <p>
          Twin Towers and Men&#8217;s Central Jail are adjacent facilities at the same downtown LA complex,
          but they have separate entrances, visiting procedures, and housing units. Twin Towers is
          the nation&#8217;s largest mental health facility and also houses the Inmate Reception Center (IRC)
          where new bookings are processed. We confirm which facility the inmate is actually
          housed in before scheduling.
        </p>

        <h3>How do I find someone&#8217;s booking number at Twin Towers?</p>
        <p>
          You can search the LA County Sheriff&#8217;s Inmate Information Center online at
          <a href="https://app5.lasd.org/iic/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">app5.lasd.org/iic</a>
          using the inmate&#8217;s name and date of birth. The system will show which facility they are
          currently housed at. You can also call the 24&#8209;hour inmate information line at
          (213) 473&#8209;6080.
        </p>

        <h3>What if the inmate is in medical or mental health housing?</p>
        <p>
          Inmates in medical or mental health housing may have restricted visiting access. We coordinate
          with the facility to determine if a professional notary visit is possible and what additional
          steps may be required.
        </p>

        <h3>Can I schedule for both Twin Towers and Men&#8217;s Central in one trip?</p>
        <p>
          If you have documents for inmates at both facilities, let us know. Since they are adjacent,
          we may be able to coordinate both visits on the same day, though each facility requires
          separate check-in and security procedures.
        </p>

        <h3>What ID does the inmate need?</p>
        <p>
          Twin Towers maintains booking records with photos that can be used for identification purposes.
          If the inmate has a valid California ID, driver&#8217;s license, or passport on file, that can
          also be used. We confirm ID options before the appointment.
        </p>

        <h3>What if the inmate is transferred before the appointment?</p>
        <p>
          Inmates can be transferred between facilities with little notice. We recommend confirming
          the inmate&#8217;s location close to the appointment time. If they have been moved, we can often
          reschedule for the new facility.
