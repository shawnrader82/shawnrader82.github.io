            <h3>1. Share the inmate&#39;s information and documents</h3>
            <p>
              Call or text with the inmate&#39;s full legal name, booking or CID number if available,
              and a description of the documents to be notarized. Let us know your deadline so we can
              prioritize scheduling.
            </p>

            <h3>2. We coordinate with the Northern Branch</h3>
            <p>
              We contact the Northern Branch Jail to confirm housing location, current visiting
              procedures, and how professional visits are handled. We work within the ViaPath
              scheduling framework and coordinate with the watch commander or designated staff to
              arrange the notary visit.
            </p>

            <h3>3. Prepare your documents</h3>
            <p>
              Have all documents complete and ready before the appointment. We cannot draft legal
              documents or provide legal advice &#8212; our role is to verify identity, witness
              signatures, and complete the notarization. If the inmate needs to review documents
              ahead of time, coordinate with their attorney or send copies through the jail&#39;s
              mail or email systems.

              to the designated visiting area. The inmate confirms their identity, signs the documents
              in our presence, and we complete the notarial certificate.
            </p>

            <h3>5. Returning the signed and notarized documents</h3>

              After the visit, we return the originals to you, your attorney, a title or escrow
              company, or any other designated recipient. Depending on your deadlines, we can
              hand-deliver locally, overnight by courier, or return by mail.

          Inmates at the Northern Branch Jail are generally allowed up to four visits per week. All
          visitors must be on the inmate&#39;s approved visitor list and must check in with the same
          photo ID used to register.

        <h3>Is this the same facility as the Santa Barbara County Main Jail?</h3>
        <p>
          No. The Northern Branch Jail in Santa Maria and the
          <a href="/services/notary-jail/sba-main-jail.html">Main Jail on Calle Real</a> in Santa
          Barbara are separate facilities about 65 miles apart. Both are operated by the Santa Barbara
          County Sheriff&#39;s Office. Many social visits for county inmates are handled here at the
          Northern Branch.

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>How long does a notary appointment at the Northern Branch take?</h3>
        <p>
          Plan for 5 to 7 hours total, including travel from Los Angeles to Santa Maria (approximately
          2.5 hours each way), check-in with custody staff, wait time, and the signing itself. The
          notarization portion is quick, but the distance adds significant travel time.

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Can I look up an inmate at the Northern Branch Jail?</h3>
        <p>
          Yes. You can search the Santa Barbara County Sheriff&#39;s Office inmate locator online or
          call the Northern Branch Jail at (805) 554&#8209;3100 with the inmate&#39;s name and date
          of birth.
