      <h2>Scheduling a Notary Appointment at the Musick Facility</h2>
      <ol class="steps-list">
        <li>
          <h3>Contact us with the inmate&#39;s information</h3>
          <p>Call or text with the inmate&#39;s full legal name, booking number (if known), and a description of the documents that need to be notarized. Let us know your deadline so we can prioritize scheduling.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>We coordinate with Musick</h3>
          <p>We confirm current visiting procedures, professional visit scheduling, and ensure the inmate is available and housed at the Musick Facility (not temporarily transferred for court or medical reasons).</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Prepare your documents</h3>
          <p>Have all documents ready and complete before the appointment &mdash; we cannot draft legal documents, only notarize signatures. If the inmate needs to review documents first, coordinate with their attorney or use the facility&#39;s mail system.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>The notary appointment</h3>
          <p>We travel from Los Angeles to the Musick Facility in Irvine, check in with facility staff, and meet with the inmate. The inmate confirms their identity, signs the documents in our presence, and we complete the notarization.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Document delivery</h3>
          <p>After the appointment, we return the signed and notarized documents to you, your attorney, escrow company, or other designated recipient &mdash; by hand delivery, courier, or mail depending on your timeline.</p>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p class="tip"><strong>Tip:</strong> Musick is the farthest OC facility from Los Angeles, so scheduling with extra lead time helps. That said, we accommodate urgent requests whenever possible.</p>
