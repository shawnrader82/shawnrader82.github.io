      <h2>Scheduling a Notary Appointment at Theo Lacy</h2>
      <ol class="steps-list">
        <li>
          <h3>Contact us with the inmate&#39;s information</h3>
          <p>Call or text with the inmate&#39;s full legal name, booking number (if known), and a description of the documents that need to be notarized. Let us know your deadline so we can prioritize scheduling.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>We coordinate with Theo Lacy</h3>
          <p>The Theo Lacy Facility has specific procedures for professional visits. We confirm the current visiting schedule, any advance requirements, and ensure the inmate is available and housed at Theo Lacy.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Prepare your documents</h3>
          <p>Have all documents ready and complete before the appointment &mdash; we cannot draft legal documents, only notarize signatures. If the inmate needs to review documents first, coordinate with their attorney or use the facility&#39;s mail system.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>The notary appointment</h3>
          <p>We travel from Los Angeles to the Theo Lacy Facility in Orange, clear security screening, and meet with the inmate in the designated professional visiting area. The inmate confirms their identity, signs the documents in our presence, and we complete the notarization.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Document delivery</h3>
          <p>After the appointment, we return the signed and notarized documents to you, your attorney, escrow company, or other designated recipient &mdash; by hand delivery, courier, or mail depending on your timeline.</p>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p class="tip"><strong>Tip:</strong> Theo Lacy is a busy facility with thousands of inmates. Professional visit scheduling can fill up &mdash; give us as much notice as possible, but we understand jail notarizations are often urgent and will do our best to accommodate same-day or next-day requests.</p>
