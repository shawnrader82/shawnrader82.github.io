      <div class="service-detail-grid">
        <div>
          <p class="service-detail-lead">
            The Larry D. Smith Correctional Facility is located at 1627 South Hargrave Street in Banning,
            California, near the Interstate 10 freeway in the San Gorgonio Pass area. The facility is
            operated by the Riverside County Sheriff’s Department and primarily houses sentenced inmates
            serving county time, as well as some pre‑trial detainees.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Address:</strong> 1627 S Hargrave Street, Banning, CA 92220</li>
            <li><strong>Operated by:</strong> Riverside County Sheriff’s Department</li>
            <li><strong>Type:</strong> Riverside County correctional facility (sentenced &amp; pre‑trial)</li>
            <li><strong>Approximate distance from Los Angeles:</strong> About 1.5 hours via I‑10</li>
            <li><strong>Housing:</strong> Multiple housing units, each with its own visiting schedule</li>

        <div>
          <h3>Why inmates at Smith Correctional need notary services</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Sentenced county time</strong> — Inmates serving longer local sentences often need to manage property, finances, and legal affairs.</li>
            <li><strong>Pre‑trial legal needs</strong> — Declarations, affidavits, and other court documents needed before hearings.</li>
            <li><strong>Powers of attorney</strong> — Authorizing family members or attorneys to act on their behalf while in custody.</li>
            <li><strong>Real estate and business deadlines</strong> — Documents with firm escrow dates, loan deadlines, or contracts that cannot wait.</li>

      <h2>Scheduling a Notary Appointment at Smith Correctional</h2>

      <div class="service-detail-grid">
        <div>
          <div class="faq-item" style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6;">
            <h3>1. Contact us with the inmate’s information</h3>
            <p>
              Call or text with the inmate’s full legal name, booking number (if known), housing unit if
              available, and a description of the documents that need to be notarized. Let us know your
              deadline so we can prioritize scheduling.
            </p>

            <h3>2. We schedule with the facility</h3>
            <p>
              Riverside County facilities require visits to be scheduled at least one day in advance. For
              attorney or professional visits at Smith Correctional, we contact the facility directly at
              (951) 922‑7300 to coordinate scheduling and confirm the correct visiting window for the
              inmate’s housing unit.
            </p>

            <h3>3. Prepare your documents</h3>
            <p>
              Have all documents ready and complete before the appointment — we cannot draft legal documents,
              only notarize signatures. If the inmate needs to review documents first, coordinate with their
              attorney or use the facility’s mail system.
            </p>

            <h3>4. The notary appointment in Banning</h3>
            <p>
              We travel from Los Angeles to Smith Correctional in Banning (approximately 1.5 hours), clear
              security screening, and meet with the inmate in the designated visiting area. Visitor check‑in
              begins 60 minutes before and closes 20 minutes before the start time, so we plan to arrive
              early. The inmate confirms their identity, signs the documents, and we complete the
              notarization.
            </p>

            <h3>5. Document delivery</h3>
            <p>
              After the appointment, we return the signed and notarized documents to you, your attorney,
              escrow company, or other designated recipient — by hand delivery, courier, or mail depending
              on your timeline.

      <div class="service-detail-kicker">Common Questions</div>
      <h2>Larry D. Smith Correctional Facility Notary FAQs</h2>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Where is the Larry D. Smith Correctional Facility located?</h3>
        <p>
          Smith Correctional is located at 1627 S Hargrave Street, Banning, CA 92220, near the I‑10 freeway
          in the San Gorgonio Pass area. It is approximately 1.5 hours from Los Angeles by car.
        </p>

        <h3>How do I confirm someone is at Smith Correctional?</h3>
        <p>
          You can search the Riverside County Sheriff’s inmate locator online or call the facility at
          (951) 922‑7300 with the inmate’s name and date of birth to confirm they are housed at Larry D.
          Smith Correctional Facility.
        </p>

        <h3>How are visits scheduled at Larry D. Smith Correctional Facility?</h3>
        <p>
          You can call (951) 922‑7540 between 9:00 AM and 5:00 PM daily to schedule visits, and visits must
          be scheduled at least one day in advance. For attorney or professional visits, the facility is
          contacted at (951) 922‑7300 to coordinate directly.
        </p>

        <h3>What are the check‑in rules for visits?</h3>
        <p>
          Visitor check‑in begins 60 minutes before the scheduled visit and closes 20 minutes before the
          start time. Visitors who arrive during the final 20 minutes before the visit will not be allowed
          to check in, so arriving early is essential.
        </p>

        <h3>What ID does the inmate need for notarization?</h3>
        <p>
          The facility maintains booking records that can be used for identification. If the inmate has a
          valid California ID, driver’s license, or passport on file, that can also be used. We confirm ID
          options with the facility before the appointment.
        </p>

        <h3>How long should I plan for a Smith Correctional notary appointment?</h3>
        <p>
          Plan for 4 to 5 hours total including travel from Los Angeles (approximately 1.5 hours each way),
          security screening, wait time, and the signing. The notarization itself is quick, but travel and
          facility procedures add significant time.
