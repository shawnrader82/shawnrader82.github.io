            <h3>1. Share the inmate&#39;s information and documents</h3>
            <p>
              Call or text with the inmate&#39;s full legal name, booking or CID number if available,
              and a description of the documents to be notarized. Let us know your deadline so we can
              prioritize scheduling.
            </p>

            <h3>2. We coordinate with custody staff</h3>
            <p>
              We contact the Main Jail to confirm housing location, current visiting procedures, and
              how professional visits are handled. We confirm the inmate is at the Calle Real facility
              and not the Northern Branch Jail in Santa Maria.
            </p>

            <h3>3. Prepare your documents</h3>
            <p>
              Have all documents complete and ready before the appointment. We cannot draft legal
              documents or provide legal advice &#8212; our role is to verify identity, witness
              signatures, and complete the notarization. If the inmate needs to review documents
              ahead of time, coordinate with their attorney or send copies through the jail&#39;s
              mail or email systems.

            <p>
              We travel from Los Angeles to Santa Barbara, check in with custody staff, and are
              escorted to a non-contact visiting area. The inmate confirms their identity, signs the
              documents in our presence, and we complete the notarial certificate.
            </p>

            <h3>5. Returning the signed and notarized documents</h3>
            <p>
              After the visit, we return the originals to you, your attorney, a title or escrow
              company, or any other designated recipient. Depending on your deadlines, we can
              hand-deliver locally, overnight by courier, or return by mail.

      <h2>Santa Barbara County Jail Notary FAQs</h2>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Where is the Santa Barbara County Main Jail?</h3>
        <p>
          The Santa Barbara County Main Jail is located at 4436 Calle Real, Santa Barbara, CA 93110.
          It is the county&#39;s primary jail and houses male and female inmates awaiting trial or
          serving county sentences.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Are independent mobile notaries allowed at Santa Barbara County Jail?</h3>
        <p>
          Yes. Independent mobile notaries regularly provide services at the Santa Barbara County
          Main Jail. The notary checks in with custody staff, is escorted to a non-contact visiting
          area, and completes the notarization with the inmate.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>What ID does the inmate need for notarization?</h3>
        <p>
          Custody staff maintain booking records with photos and identifying information that can be
          used to confirm the inmate&#39;s identity. If the inmate has a valid government-issued ID
          on file, that can also be used. We confirm ID options with the facility before the appointment.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>How long does a notary appointment at the Main Jail take?</h3>
        <p>
          Plan for 3 to 5 hours total, including travel from Los Angeles, check-in with custody staff,
          escort to and from the visiting area, wait time, and the signing itself. The notarization
          portion is quick, but facility procedures and distance add time.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Is this the same facility as the Northern Branch Jail?</h3>
        <p>
          No. The Main Jail on Calle Real in Santa Barbara and the
          <a href="/services/notary-jail/sba-northern-branch.html">Northern Branch Jail</a> on Black
          Road in Santa Maria are separate facilities about 65 miles apart. Both are operated by the
          Santa Barbara County Sheriff&#39;s Office. Make sure you know which facility the inmate is
