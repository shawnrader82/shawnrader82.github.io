      <h2>Scheduling a Notary Appointment at Smith Correctional</h2>
      <ol class="steps-list">
        <li>
          <h3>Contact us with the inmate&#39;s information</h3>
          <p>Call or text with the inmate&#39;s full legal name, booking number (if known), and a description of the documents that need to be notarized. Let us know your deadline so we can prioritize scheduling.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>We coordinate with the facility</h3>
          <p>Riverside County facilities require visits to be scheduled at least one day in advance. For attorney or professional visits at Smith Correctional, we contact the facility directly at (951) 922-7300 to coordinate scheduling. Due to the remote Banning location, we plan the trip carefully to ensure timely arrival.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Prepare your documents</h3>
          <p>Have all documents ready and complete before the appointment &mdash; we cannot draft legal documents, only notarize signatures. If the inmate needs to review documents first, coordinate with their attorney or use the facility&#39;s mail system.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>The notary appointment</h3>
          <p>We travel from Los Angeles to Smith Correctional in Banning (approximately 1.5 hours), clear security screening, and meet with the inmate in the designated visiting area. Visitor check-in begins 60 minutes before and closes 20 minutes before the start time, so we plan to arrive early. The inmate confirms their identity, signs the documents, and we complete the notarization.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Document delivery</h3>
          <p>After the appointment, we return the signed and notarized documents to you, your attorney, escrow company, or other designated recipient &mdash; by hand delivery, courier, or mail depending on your timeline.</p>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p class="tip"><strong>Tip:</strong> Smith Correctional has multiple housing units, each with their own visiting schedule. When you contact us, provide the inmate&#39;s housing unit or booking number so we can coordinate the correct visiting window. Visitor check-in closes 20 minutes before the scheduled start time, so arriving late means a wasted trip.</p>
