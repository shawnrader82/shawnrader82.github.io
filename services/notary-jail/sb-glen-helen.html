            <li><strong>Real estate transactions</strong> — Deeds, refinancing documents, or property transfers with firm closing dates.</li>
            <li><strong>Family law documents</strong> — Divorce paperwork, custody agreements, and support modifications that require notarized signatures.</li>
          </ul>

          <div class="faq-item" style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6;">
            <h3>1. Contact us with the inmate’s information</h3>
            <p>
              Call or text with the inmate’s full legal name, booking number (if known), and a description
              of the documents that need to be notarized. Let us know your deadline so we can prioritize
              scheduling.
            </p>

            <h3>2. We coordinate with the facility</h3>
            <p>
              San Bernardino County facilities require professional visits to be scheduled in advance. We
              confirm current procedures, visiting availability, and ensure the inmate is still housed at
              Glen Helen and not temporarily transferred.
            </p>

            <h3>3. Prepare your documents</h3>
            <p>
              Have all documents ready and complete before the appointment — we cannot draft legal documents,
              only notarize signatures. If the inmate needs to review documents first, coordinate with their
              attorney or use the facility’s mail system.

            <h3>4. The notary appointment in Devore</h3>
            <p>
              We travel from Los Angeles to Glen Helen in Devore, clear security screening, and meet with the
              inmate in the designated visiting area. The inmate confirms their identity, signs the documents
              in our presence, and we complete the notarization with the appropriate California notarial
              certificate.
            </p>

            <h3>5. Document delivery</h3>
            <p>
              After the appointment, we return the signed and notarized documents to you, your attorney,
              escrow company, or other designated recipient — by hand delivery, courier, or mail depending on
              your timeline.

    <div class="service-detail-inner">
      <div class="service-detail-kicker">Common Questions</div>
      <h2>Glen Helen Rehabilitation Center Notary FAQs</h2>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Where is Glen Helen Rehabilitation Center?</h3>
        <p>
          Glen Helen is located at 18000 Institution Rd, Devore, CA 92407, approximately 12 miles northwest
          of downtown San Bernardino and about 60 to 80 minutes from Los Angeles via I‑15.
        </p>

        <h3>How do I find out if someone is at Glen Helen?</h3>
        <p>
          You can search the San Bernardino County Sheriff’s inmate locator online or call (909) 708‑8371
          with the inmate’s name and date of birth to confirm they are housed at Glen Helen.
        </p>

        <h3>What are the visiting hours at Glen Helen?</h3>
        <p>
          Public visiting hours are Wednesday through Saturday, 8:30 AM to 7:00 PM, by appointment only.
          Visits must be scheduled at least one day in advance by calling (909) 887‑0364. Attorneys may visit
          any day of the week with advance notice.
        </p>

        <h3>Does Glen Helen house women?</h3>
        <p>
          Yes. Glen Helen has separate male and female facilities on the same campus. The female facility has
          a capacity of about 326 inmates and houses both pre‑trial and sentenced women.
        </p>

        <h3>What ID does the inmate need for notarization?</h3>
        <p>
          The facility maintains booking records with photos that can be used for identification. If the
          inmate has a valid California ID, driver’s license, or passport on file, that can also be used.
          We confirm ID options with the facility before the appointment.
        </p>

        <h3>How long does a notary appointment at Glen Helen take?</h3>
        <p>
          Plan for 3 to 4 hours total including travel from Los Angeles to Devore, security screening, wait
          time, and the signing. Glen Helen’s more remote location adds travel time compared to closer
          facilities.
