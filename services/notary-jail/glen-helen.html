      <h2>Scheduling a Notary Appointment at Glen Helen</h2>
      <ol class="steps-list">
        <li>
          <h3>Contact us with the inmate&#39;s information</h3>
          <p>Call or text with the inmate&#39;s full legal name, booking number (if known), and a description of the documents that need to be notarized. Let us know your deadline so we can prioritize scheduling.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>We coordinate with the facility</h3>
          <p>San Bernardino County facilities require visits to be scheduled at least one day in advance. We confirm current procedures, attorney/professional visiting availability, and ensure the inmate is still housed at Glen Helen and not temporarily transferred.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Prepare your documents</h3>
          <p>Have all documents ready and complete before the appointment &mdash; we cannot draft legal documents, only notarize signatures. If the inmate needs to review documents first, coordinate with their attorney or use the facility&#39;s mail system.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>The notary appointment</h3>
          <p>We travel from Los Angeles to Glen Helen in Devore, clear security screening, and meet with the inmate in the designated visiting area. The inmate confirms their identity, signs the documents in our presence, and we complete the notarization.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Document delivery</h3>
          <p>After the appointment, we return the signed and notarized documents to you, your attorney, escrow company, or other designated recipient &mdash; by hand delivery, courier, or mail depending on your timeline.</p>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p class="tip"><strong>Tip:</strong> Glen Helen houses both male and female inmates in separate facilities on the same campus. Make sure you know whether the inmate is in the Male or Female facility so we can coordinate with the correct unit.</p>
