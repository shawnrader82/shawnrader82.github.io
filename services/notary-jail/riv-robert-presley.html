        <div>
          <p class="service-detail-lead">
            The Robert Presley Detention Center (RPDC) is located at 4000 Orange Street in downtown
            Riverside and serves as one of the primary booking and detention facilities for Riverside
            County. The facility is operated by the Riverside County Sheriff’s Department, has a capacity
            of approximately 1,100 inmates, and handles initial booking, pre‑trial detention, and court
            appearances for the downtown Riverside courthouse area.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Address:</strong> 4000 Orange Street, Riverside, CA 92501</li>
            <li><strong>Capacity:</strong> Approximately 1,100 inmates</li>
            <li><strong>Operated by:</strong> Riverside County Sheriff’s Department</li>
            <li><strong>Role:</strong> Primary booking and detention facility for downtown Riverside courts</li>
            <li><strong>Drive time from Los Angeles:</strong> Approximately 60–80 minutes via the 60 or 91 freeways</li>

          <h3>Background and why notarizations are needed</h3>
          <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6;">
            The facility is named after former California State Senator Robert Presley, who previously
            served as Riverside County Sheriff. Its central downtown location and role as a booking center
            mean many inmates are in active court proceedings or short‑term custody, which often requires
            urgent notarized paperwork.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Court and legal filings</strong> — Declarations, affidavits, and other documents needed before hearings.</li>
            <li><strong>Powers of attorney</strong> — Allowing trusted family or attorneys to act on the inmate’s behalf.</li>
            <li><strong>Real estate and business matters</strong> — Deeds, escrow documents, and contracts with tight deadlines.</li>
            <li><strong>Family and financial issues</strong> — Notarized forms for support, custody, or financial management.</li>

        <div>
          <div class="faq-item" style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6;">
            <h3>1. Contact us with the inmate’s information</h3>
            <p>
              Call or text with the inmate’s full legal name, booking number (if known), and a description
              of the documents that need to be notarized. Let us know your deadline so we can prioritize
              scheduling.
            </p>

            <h3>2. We schedule with the facility</h3>
            <p>
              Riverside County facilities require visits to be scheduled at least one day in advance. For
              attorney or professional visits such as notarizations, we contact RPDC directly at
              (951) 955‑4500 to coordinate scheduling and confirm the inmate is currently housed at RPDC,
              not temporarily transferred.
            </p>

            <h3>3. Prepare your documents</h3>
            <p>
              Have all documents ready and complete before the appointment — we cannot draft legal documents,
              only notarize signatures. If the inmate needs to review documents first, coordinate with their
              attorney or use the facility’s mail system.

            <h3>4. The notary appointment in downtown Riverside</h3>
            <p>
              We travel from Los Angeles to RPDC in downtown Riverside, clear security screening, and meet
              with the inmate in the designated visiting area. The inmate confirms their identity, signs the
              documents in our presence, and we complete the notarization. Valid government‑issued photo ID
              is required for all visitors.
            </p>

            <h3>5. Document delivery</h3>
            <p>
              After the appointment, we return the signed and notarized documents to you, your attorney,
              escrow company, or other designated recipient — by hand delivery, courier, or mail depending
              on your timeline.

  <section class="service-detail service-detail--gray" id="rpdc-notary-faq">
    <div class="service-detail-inner">
      <div class="service-detail-kicker">Common Questions</div>
      <h2>Robert Presley Detention Center Notary FAQs</h2>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Where is the Robert Presley Detention Center located?</h3>
        <p>
          RPDC is located at 4000 Orange St, Riverside, CA 92501, in downtown Riverside. It is approximately
          60 to 80 minutes from Los Angeles depending on traffic.
        </p>

        <h3>What is RPDC’s role within Riverside County jails?</h3>
        <p>
          The Robert Presley Detention Center serves as one of the primary booking and detention facilities
          for Riverside County, handling initial booking, pre‑trial detention, and court appearances for the
          downtown Riverside courthouse area.
        </p>

        <h3>How do I confirm someone is at RPDC?</h3>
        <p>
          You can search the Riverside County Sheriff’s inmate locator online or call (951) 955‑4500 with
          the inmate’s name and date of birth to confirm they are housed at the Robert Presley Detention
          Center.
        </p>

        <h3>How are visits scheduled at Robert Presley Detention Center?</h3>
        <p>
          You can call (951) 341‑8888 between 9:00 AM and 5:00 PM daily to schedule visits, and visits must
          be scheduled at least one day in advance. For attorney or professional visits, the facility is
          contacted directly at (951) 955‑4500 to coordinate scheduling.
        </p>

        <h3>What ID does the inmate need for notarization?</h3>
        <p>
          The facility maintains booking records that can be used for identification. If the inmate has a
          valid California ID, driver’s license, or passport on file, that can also be used. We confirm ID
          options with the facility before the appointment.
        </p>

        <h3>What about parking at RPDC?</h3>
        <p>
          RPDC is in downtown Riverside. Metered parking is available on surrounding streets, and two public
          parking structures are located at the corner of Lemon and 12th Street. Plan extra time for parking
          and walking to the facility.
        </p>

        <h3>How long should I plan for a Riverside jail notary appointment?</h3>
        <p>
          Plan for 3 to 4 hours total including travel from Los Angeles (60 to 80 minutes each way), security
          screening, wait time, and the signing. The notarization itself is quick, but travel and facility
          procedures add time.
