  <div class="service-detail-inner">
    <div class="service-detail-kicker">The Process</div>
    <h2>How a Jail Wedding Works</h2>
    <p class="service-detail-lead">
      Most jail weddings follow these five steps. The full process typically takes 1–4 weeks
      depending on the facility, approval timelines, and scheduling availability.
    </p>

    <div class="service-detail-grid">
      <div>
        <h3>Step 1 — Facility Approval</h3>
        <p>When required, we help you obtain approval to marry at the facility where the inmate
          is housed. Some facilities, such as LA County jails, require prior approval from the
          Sheriff's legal department.</p>

        <h3 style="margin-top:16px;">Step 2 — Notary Visit to the Inmate</h3>
        <p>Our notary visits the inmate at the facility to sign the required marriage paperwork,
          including the Affidavit of Inability to Appear at the County Clerk's office.</p>

        <h3 style="margin-top:16px;">Step 3 — Marriage License Pickup</h3>
        <p>Our minister accompanies the non‑incarcerated spouse to the County Clerk to purchase
          the marriage license. By regulation, the minister must be present when an inmate is involved.</p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h3>Step 4 — Wedding Ceremony</h3>
        <p>We meet both parties at the facility during visiting hours and officiate the marriage
          ceremony on site.</p>

        <h3 style="margin-top:16px;">Step 5 — Filing &amp; Certificate</h3>
        <p>After the ceremony, the minister files the signed marriage license with the County
          Recorder. Your official marriage certificate arrives within 3–10 weeks depending
          on the county.</p>
