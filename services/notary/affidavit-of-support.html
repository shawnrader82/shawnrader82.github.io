    <h2>What Is An Immigration Affidavit Of Support?</h2>
    <p class="service-detail-lead">
      An immigration affidavit of support is a sworn statement that you will provide financial support for
      someone applying for a visa or green card. It is intended to show the government that the person you
      are sponsoring will not become a public charge and that you are able and willing to help them.
    </p>

    <div class="service-detail-grid">
      <div>
        <h3>Common Contexts</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Family based green card sponsorships where you support a spouse, child, or relative.</li>
          <li>Fiance visas and other temporary visas that require proof of financial backing.</li>
          <li>Consular processing cases handled at a U.S. embassy or consulate overseas.</li>
          <li>Adjustment of status applications filed inside the United States.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h3>Different Forms And Formats</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Form I-864</strong> - Official USCIS Affidavit of Support for many family cases.</li>
          <li><strong>Form I-134</strong> - Affidavit of Support often used for certain temporary visas.</li>
          <li>Attorney drafted affidavits and letters of support tailored to your case.</li>
          <li>Personal support letters that explain your relationship and commitment to help.</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="margin-top:12px; font-size:13px; color:var(--text-muted);">
          The official I-864 form itself does not require notarization, but additional affidavits and
          support letters often do. Always follow the instructions from your attorney or the agency
          handling your case.

    <h2>When Immigration Affidavits Of Support Need Notarization</h2>
    <p class="service-detail-lead">
      Not every immigration form needs a notary, but many sworn statements and support letters do. When
      in doubt, agencies and attorneys often prefer notarization because it adds credibility and helps
      prevent fraud.
    </p>

    <div class="service-detail-grid">
      <div>
        <h3>Often Notarized</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Separate affidavits that explain your ability to support the immigrant.</li>
          <li>Letters of support from friends or family that need to be sworn statements.</li>
          <li>Affidavits of residence, relationship, or employment supporting an application.</li>
          <li>Financial affidavits for consulates or foreign government offices.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h3>Sometimes Not Notarized</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Form I-864 itself, which is usually signed under penalty of perjury instead of notarized.</li>
          <li>Online or electronically signed immigration forms that use their own verification process.</li>
          <li>Internal questionnaires and worksheets your attorney uses for drafting.</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="margin-top:12px; font-size:13px; color:#e5e7eb;">
          If you are not sure whether a specific document must be notarized, check with your attorney,
          the consulate, or the agency that requested it. The notary cannot decide which documents are
          required for your case.

    <h2>How Immigration Affidavits Of Support Are Notarized</h2>

    <div class="service-detail-grid">
      <div>
        <h3>Type Of Notarization</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Most affidavits of support and support letters use a jurat, because you are swearing the facts are true.</li>
          <li>With a jurat, you sign in front of the notary and take an oath or affirmation.</li>
          <li>If the document includes its own notarial certificate, the notary will follow that language.</li>
          <li>If there is no certificate, the notary will ask whether an acknowledgment or jurat is needed based on instructions from you or the requesting agency.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h3>Step By Step At Your Appointment</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>The mobile notary arrives at your chosen location and reviews your ID.</li>
          <li>You confirm that the document is complete and that you understand what it says.</li>
          <li>The notary administers an oath or affirmation if the affidavit uses a jurat.</li>
          <li>You sign the affidavit in front of the notary.</li>
          <li>The notary completes the notarial certificate, applies their seal, and records the notarization in their journal.</li>
        </ol>
      </div>
    </div>

    <p style="font-size:12px; color:var(--text-muted); margin-top:20px; line-height:1.5;">
      <strong>Important:</strong> The notary does not review your immigration eligibility or advise
      you on what to say in your affidavit. Their role is to verify your identity and witness your
      sworn signature.

    <h2>Immigration Affidavit Of Support Notarization FAQ</h2>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3>What is an affidavit of support for immigration?</h3>
      <p>
        An immigration affidavit of support is a sworn statement that you will financially support
        an immigrant so they will not become a public charge. It is often used with green card
        sponsorships, visas, and other immigration benefits.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3>Does Form I-864 need to be notarized?</h3>
      <p>
        The official Form I-864 is generally signed under penalty of perjury and does not have to
        be notarized. However, you may still have other separate affidavits or letters of support
        that do require notarization, especially in consular cases or when requested by an attorney.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3>What type of notarization do immigration affidavits of support require?</h3>
      <p>
        Most immigration affidavits and support letters are sworn statements, so they use a jurat.
        The notary will administer an oath or affirmation, watch you sign, and then complete the
        jurat certificate and apply their seal.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3>Can you help me draft my immigration affidavit of support?</h3>
      <p>
        A notary cannot tell you what to say or provide legal advice. However, we bring a laptop and
        printer so you can access templates from your attorney or legal document platforms, fill them
        out yourself, and then sign and notarize them in the same visit.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3>Can immigration affidavits of support be apostilled?</h3>
      <p>
        Yes. Many consulates and foreign authorities require notarized and apostilled affidavits or
        support letters from U.S. sponsors. We can notarize your affidavit and then handle the apostille
        or legalization process if needed.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3>Can I get an immigration affidavit of support notarized the same day?</h3>
      <p>
        Same-day and next-day mobile notary appointments are frequently available. Call or text
        <a href="tel:12139332507">(213) 933-2507</a> to check current availability and scheduling.
