    <h2>What Is A Bill Of Sale?</h2>
    <p class="service-detail-lead">
      A bill of sale is a written document that records the transfer of ownership of property from a
      seller to a buyer. It includes the names of both parties, a description of the item, the sale
      price, and the date of the transaction. It serves as a receipt and proof of the agreement for
      both sides.
    </p>

    <div class="service-detail-grid">
      <div>
        <h3>Common Types Of Bills Of Sale</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Vehicle bill of sale</strong> - cars, trucks, motorcycles, and RVs sold between private parties.</li>
          <li><strong>Boat and watercraft bill of sale</strong> - sailboats, motorboats, jet skis, and other vessels.</li>
          <li><strong>Equipment and machinery bill of sale</strong> - tools, construction equipment, and commercial machinery.</li>
          <li><strong>General personal property bill of sale</strong> - furniture, electronics, jewelry, art, livestock, and other valuables.</li>
          <li><strong>Business asset bill of sale</strong> - sale of business equipment, inventory, or an entire business.</li>
        </ul>

      <div>
        <h3>Why Notarize A Bill Of Sale?</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Protects the buyer by proving the seller voluntarily transferred ownership.</li>
          <li>Protects the seller by proving the buyer agreed to the terms and price.</li>
          <li>Reduces the risk of disputes about what was agreed and when.</li>
          <li>Some out-of-state DMVs require a notarized bill of sale to register a vehicle purchased in California.</li>
          <li>Lenders and insurance companies may require notarization for high-value transactions.</li>
          <li>A notarized bill of sale carries more weight if the transaction is ever disputed in court.</li>

    <h2>Bill Of Sale Notarization Rules In California</h2>
    <p class="service-detail-lead">
      California does not require notarization for most private-party bills of sale. However, there
      are situations where notarization is either required or strongly recommended.
    </p>

    <div class="service-detail-grid">
      <div>
        <h3>When Notarization May Be Required</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>The buyer is registering the vehicle in another state that requires a notarized bill of sale.</li>
          <li>A lien exists on the vehicle and DMV forms like the REG 227 or REG 166 are involved, which may need notarization.</li>
          <li>A financial institution or lender requires notarization before releasing funds or processing a loan.</li>
          <li>The transaction involves a business sale or high-value property where both parties want added legal protection.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h3>When Notarization Is Recommended</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Any private-party vehicle sale where the buyer and seller do not know each other well.</li>
          <li>Sales involving older or classic vehicles where title history may be unclear.</li>
          <li>High-value personal property transactions like equipment, art, or jewelry.</li>
          <li>Any time either party wants proof that the other person signed willingly and showed proper ID.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </div>

    <p style="font-size:12px; color:#9ca3af; margin-top:20px; line-height:1.5;">
      <strong>Note:</strong> For standard California vehicle transfers, the DMV accepts the bill of sale
      section on the REG 262 form or the standalone REG 135 form. Neither requires notarization by
      default. However, having a notarized bill of sale adds a layer of protection beyond the minimum
      requirements.

    <div class="service-detail-grid">
      <div>
        <h3>Who Needs To Be Present</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Both the buyer and the seller should be present with valid, current government issued photo ID.</li>
          <li>If only one party's signature needs notarization, only that person is required.</li>
          <li>If a representative is signing on behalf of one party using a power of attorney, they must bring the original POA and their own ID.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h3>At Your Appointment</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>The mobile notary arrives at the agreed location and reviews each signer's ID.</li>
          <li>Both parties review the bill of sale and confirm the details are correct.</li>
          <li>The notary determines whether an acknowledgment or jurat is needed based on the document language.</li>
          <li>Both parties sign in front of the notary.</li>
          <li>The notary completes the notarial certificate, applies their seal, and records the notarization in their journal.</li>
        </ol>
      </div>
    </div>

    <p style="font-size:12px; color:var(--text-muted); margin-top:20px; line-height:1.5;">
      <strong>Tip:</strong> We can meet you at the location where the transaction is happening, whether
      that is a parking lot, mechanic shop, marina, or either party's home or office. This way the item
      can be inspected and the paperwork can be signed in the same visit.

    <h2>Bill Of Sale Notarization FAQ</h2>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3>Does a bill of sale need to be notarized in California?</h3>
      <p>
        California does not require notarization for most private vehicle or boat bills of sale. However,
        notarization is strongly recommended because it protects both the buyer and seller. Some lenders,
        out-of-state DMVs, and private parties may require or prefer a notarized copy before completing
        the transaction.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3>When is a notarized bill of sale required?</h3>
      <p>
        A notarized bill of sale may be required when the buyer is registering in another state that
        requires it, when a lender or financial institution requests it, when replacement title forms
        with liens are involved, or when the transaction is high value and both parties want extra
        protection.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3>What should a bill of sale include?</h3>
      <p>
        A proper bill of sale should include the full legal names and contact information of the buyer
        and seller, a description of the item with make, model, year, and VIN or serial number, the
        sale price and payment method, the date of sale, and signatures of both parties.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3>What type of notarization does a bill of sale require?</h3>
      <p>
        A bill of sale typically uses an acknowledgment, where both parties confirm their identities
        and that they are signing voluntarily. If the document includes sworn statements about the
        condition or history of the item, a jurat may be used instead.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3>Can a mobile notary create a bill of sale at the appointment?</h3>
      <p>
        Yes. We bring a laptop, printer, and scanner. You can use Rocket Lawyer or another legal
        document platform to create a bill of sale on the spot, then both parties sign and we notarize
        it in one visit.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3>Can I get a bill of sale notarized the same day?</h3>
      <p>
        Same-day and next-day appointments are frequently available. We can meet you at the location
        where the transaction is happening.
