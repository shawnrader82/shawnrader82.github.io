      Everyday documents still deserve careful, convenient notarization. A mobile notary travels to
      your home, office, hospital, or other location in Los Angeles so you can sign and notarize
      powers of attorney, affidavits, bills of sale, guardianship documents, travel consent letters,
      and more without fighting traffic or office hours.

    <p class="service-detail-lead">
      General mobile notary work includes most of the personal, family, and business documents you
      encounter in day-to-day life. Instead of traveling to multiple offices, you can handle several
      notarizations in a single visit where you are.
    </p>

    <div class="service-detail-grid">
      <div>
        <h3>Common Personal Documents</h3>

          <li>Name change and same-name affidavits for inconsistent records.</li>
          <li>Guardianship and temporary custody authorizations for minors.</li>
          <li>Minor travel consent letters and DS-3053 passport consent forms.</li>

          <li>Immigration affidavits of support and related sworn statements.</li>
          <li>Many other forms that require acknowledgments or jurats under California law.</li>

        <p style="margin-top:12px; font-size:13px; color:var(--text-muted);">
          If you are not sure whether your document can be notarized, you can text a photo (with any

    <h2>What To Expect From A General Mobile Notary Visit</h2>
    <p class="service-detail-lead">
      The process is designed to be simple, compliant with California notary law, and respectful of
      your time. Most appointments take place in 30 to 45 minutes, depending on the number of
      documents and signers.

      <div>
        <h3>Before The Appointment</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>You contact us with your location, document type, number of signers, and any deadlines.</li>
          <li>We confirm availability, travel fees, and the per-signature notary fees based on your situation.</li>
          <li>You gather valid IDs, any required witnesses, and make sure documents are filled out but not signed.</li>

          <li>The appropriate notarial act (acknowledgment or jurat) is performed, and each signer signs in the notary's presence when required.</li>
          <li>The notary completes the certificate, applies their seal, records the notarization in the journal, and returns the documents to you.</li>
        </ol>
        <p style="font-size:12px; color:var(--text-muted); margin-top:20px; line-height:1.5;">
          <strong>Important:</strong> The notary's role is to verify identity, witness signatures, and
          complete required notarial certificates. For legal advice, document selection, or strategy,
          you should consult an attorney or the organization that requested the documents.

<section class="service-detail service-detail--white">
  <div class="service-detail-inner">
    <div class="service-detail-kicker">Frequently Asked Questions</div>
    <h2>General Mobile Notary FAQ</h2>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3>What is a mobile notary?</h3>
      <p>
        A mobile notary is a commissioned notary public who travels to meet you where you are — home,
        office, hospital, jail, or another agreed location — instead of requiring you to visit a fixed
        office or bank branch.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3>Which documents can you notarize?</h3>
      <p>
        Most everyday documents that use standard California acknowledgment or jurat certificates can
        be notarized, including powers of attorney, affidavits, bills of sale, guardianship forms,
        travel consent letters, copy certification statements, and many more.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3>What identification do I need?</h3>
      <p>
        Each signer must present valid, current government issued photo ID, such as a drivers license,
        state ID, passport, or another ID that meets California notary requirements. Expired IDs are
        generally not acceptable.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3>Can you explain my documents or tell me what to sign?</h3>
      <p>
        The notary can explain which parts of the document are for notarization, but cannot give legal
        advice, interpret legal language, or recommend which document you should sign. For that, you
        should speak with your attorney, lender, or the requesting agency.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3>Can you bring a printer or help if I do not have the document ready?</h3>
      <p>
        Yes. A mobile office setup with a laptop, portable printer, and scanner can be brought to your
        appointment so you can access templates from your attorney, bank, consulate, or a legal document
        platform, then print, sign, and notarize in one visit.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3>Do you handle apostille and international use?</h3>
      <p>
        Many notarized documents can be apostilled or legalized for use in other countries. If your
        destination country or consulate requires an apostille, we can notarize your documents and
        coordinate the apostille or legalization process as a separate service.
