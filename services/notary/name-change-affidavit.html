    <h2>What Is A Name Change Or Same-Name Affidavit?</h2>
    <p class="service-detail-lead">
      A name change or same-name affidavit is a sworn statement where you explain how different versions
      of your name all refer to the same person. It is often used when you have changed your name, your
      name was recorded differently in the past, or there are spelling differences across important
      documents.
    </p>

    <div class="service-detail-grid">
      <div>
        <h3>Common Name Mismatches</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Marriage or divorce leading to different last names across records.</li>
          <li>Middle names, initials, or maiden names appearing inconsistently.</li>
          <li>Spelling variations or transliteration differences from another language.</li>
          <li>Nicknames or shortened names used on school, employment, or bank records.</li>
          <li>Old documents issued before an official legal name change.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h3>Where These Affidavits Are Used</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Immigration and consular cases where documents show different names.</li>
          <li>Passport and visa applications that need an explanation for name variations.</li>
          <li>Banking, investment, and retirement accounts with mismatched records.</li>
          <li>Real estate transactions and title work that require clear identity.</li>
          <li>Professional licensing, school enrollment, and employment onboarding.</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="margin-top:12px; font-size:13px; color:var(--text-muted);">
          The affidavit does not change your legal name by itself. It explains that documents issued
          under different names all belong to you, so agencies and institutions can accept them together.

    <h2>Situations Where A Name Change Affidavit Helps</h2>
    <p class="service-detail-lead">
      Name change and same-name affidavits are requested in many different contexts. Having the
      notarized affidavit ready before an application or appointment can prevent delays and repeated
      requests for proof.
    </p>

    <div class="service-detail-grid">
      <div>
        <h3>Immigration, Passport &amp; Consular</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>USCIS or NVC asks you to explain different names in your file.</li>
          <li>A foreign consulate needs proof that your maiden and married names are the same person.</li>
          <li>Passport renewal or first-time passport where birth certificate and ID names do not match.</li>
          <li>Visa applications that combine school, employment, and marriage records under different names.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h3>Banking, Property &amp; Everyday Use</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Opening or updating bank, brokerage, or retirement accounts with mixed name history.</li>
          <li>Real estate closings where title, ID, and loan documents show different versions of your name.</li>
          <li>Employer or licensing board questions about mismatched names on transcripts or certifications.</li>
          <li>Linking older court, school, or medical records to your current legal name.</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="margin-top:12px; font-size:13px; color:#e5e7eb;">
          Agencies may provide their own affidavit form or ask you to supply one. Always follow the
          specific instructions given by your attorney, consulate, or institution.

    <h2>Types Of Name Change &amp; Same-Name Affidavits</h2>
    <p class="service-detail-lead">
      Most name change affidavits follow a similar pattern: you identify yourself, list the different
      versions of your name, and explain why they differ. Some organizations use their own forms, while
      others accept a general sworn statement.
    </p>

    <div class="service-detail-grid">
      <div>
        <h3>General Same-Name Affidavit</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>States your current legal name and any former or alternate names.</li>
          <li>Confirms that all listed names refer to the same individual.</li>
          <li>May reference key documents such as passport, birth certificate, or marriage certificate.</li>
          <li>Usually notarized with a jurat because you are swearing the information is true.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 style="margin-top:18px;">Affidavit For Marriage Or Divorce Name Changes</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Explains a change from a maiden name to a married name or back again.</li>
          <li>Often used when marriage or divorce records are from another country or state.</li>
          <li>Helps connect older school, work, or property records to your current name.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h3>Affidavits For Spelling &amp; Transliteration</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Covers spelling differences between documents (for example, accents, double letters, or reversed name order).</li>
          <li>Common when names are translated or transliterated from another language.</li>
          <li>Explains why the spellings differ while confirming that both refer to you.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 style="margin-top:18px;">What Your Affidavit Should Include</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Your full current legal name, date of birth, and contact information.</li>
          <li>A list of all other names, spellings, or versions that appear on your documents.</li>
          <li>A short explanation of why the names are different.</li>
          <li>A clear statement that all of the names belong to the same person: you.</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="margin-top:12px; font-size:13px; color:var(--text-muted);">
          The requesting agency should tell you if they need specific language. When in doubt, confirm
          with your attorney, bank, or consulate before finalizing the wording.

          <li>With a jurat, you must sign in front of the notary and take an oath or affirmation.</li>
          <li>If your form already has preprinted notarial wording, the notary will follow that language.</li>

        <ol>

      <strong>Important:</strong> The notary verifies your identity and witnesses your signature but

        A name change affidavit or same-name affidavit is a sworn statement where you explain and
        confirm that different versions of your name all refer to the same person. It is used when
        your current legal name does not exactly match the name that appears on other documents.

      <h3>When do I need a name change or same-name affidavit?</h3>
      <p>
        You may need one for immigration cases, passport and consular matters, bank and financial
        records, real estate transactions, employment or licensing, or any situation where an agency
        or institution questions name mismatches between documents.

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3>Does a name change affidavit need to be notarized?</h3>
      <p>
        Most name change and same-name affidavits are sworn statements and are expected to be
        notarized. Notarization adds credibility and helps agencies, banks, and consulates trust
        that the statement is genuine.

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3>What type of notarization does a name change affidavit require?</h3>
      <p>
        Most name change affidavits use a jurat, because you are swearing or affirming that the
        information is true. The notary administers an oath or affirmation and watches you sign.
        If your form calls for an acknowledgment instead, the notary will follow that wording.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3>Can you help me draft my same-name affidavit?</h3>
      <p>
        A notary cannot provide legal advice or choose wording for you, but we bring a laptop and
        portable printer so you can use templates from your attorney, bank, consulate, or a legal
        document platform to draft the affidavit, then sign and notarize it in one visit.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3>Can a name change affidavit be apostilled for use in another country?</h3>
      <p>
        Yes. After your name change or same-name affidavit is notarized, it can often be apostilled
        or legalized for use overseas. This is common when foreign consulates, embassies, or banks
        need proof that your documents with different names belong to the same person.
