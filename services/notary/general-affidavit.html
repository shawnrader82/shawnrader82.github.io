    <h2>What Is A General Affidavit Or Sworn Statement?</h2>
    <p class="service-detail-lead">
      A general affidavit is a written statement of facts that you swear or affirm are true in front of
      a notary public. It is used when there is no preprinted form, but a court, agency, or organization
      needs your statement under oath instead of just a regular letter.
    </p>

    <div class="service-detail-grid">
      <div>
        <h3>Common Uses</h3>

    <h2>How General Affidavits And Sworn Statements Are Notarized</h2>

    <div class="service-detail-grid">
      <div>
        <h3>Type Of Notarization</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>General affidavits almost always use a jurat, because you are swearing the contents are true.</li>
          <li>With a jurat, you must sign in front of the notary and take an oath or affirmation.</li>
          <li>If the affidavit already contains notarial language, the notary will follow that language.</li>
          <li>If it does not, the notary will ask whether the requesting party expects a jurat or acknowledgment.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h3>At Your Appointment</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>The mobile notary arrives at your chosen location and reviews your valid photo ID.</li>
          <li>You confirm that the affidavit is complete and that you understand what it says.</li>
          <li>The notary administers an oath or affirmation, asking if the contents are true.</li>
          <li>You sign the affidavit in front of the notary.</li>
          <li>The notary completes the jurat certificate, applies their seal, and records the notarization in their journal.</li>
        </ol>
      </div>
    </div>

    <p style="font-size:12px; color:var(--text-muted); margin-top:20px; line-height:1.5;">
      <strong>Note:</strong> The notary does not decide whether your affidavit answers the legal
      questions in your case. If you need help with wording or legal strategy, you should speak with
      an attorney or the person who requested the affidavit.

    <h2>General Affidavit And Sworn Statement FAQ</h2>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3>What is a general affidavit or sworn statement?</h3>
      <p>
        A general affidavit or sworn statement is a written declaration of facts that you swear or
        affirm are true in front of a notary public. It is used when an organization needs your statement
        under oath but does not provide a specific form.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3>What type of notarization does a general affidavit require?</h3>
      <p>
        Most general affidavits require a jurat, because you are swearing that the contents are true.
        The notary will administer an oath or affirmation, watch you sign, and then complete the jurat
        certificate and apply their seal.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3>What can a general affidavit be used for?</h3>
      <p>
        General affidavits can be used for court filings, insurance claims, verifying residence or
        identity, explaining events or timelines, and supporting immigration, school, or employment
        matters. The requesting party will usually tell you what they need the affidavit to address.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3>Can you help me write my affidavit?</h3>
      <p>
        A notary cannot give legal advice or choose wording for you. However, we bring a laptop and
        printer so you can use templates from Rocket Lawyer, your attorney, or other legal sources to
        draft your statement, then sign and notarize it at the same visit.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3>Can a general affidavit be apostilled for use in another country?</h3>
      <p>
        Yes. After your affidavit is notarized, it can often be apostilled or legalized so it can be
        used overseas. This is common when foreign authorities need a sworn statement from you. We can
        coordinate the apostille or legalization as part of our service.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3>Can I get a general affidavit notarized the same day?</h3>
      <p>
        Same-day and next-day mobile notary appointments are frequently available. Call or text
        <a href="tel:12139332507">(213) 933-2507</a> to check current availability and scheduling.
