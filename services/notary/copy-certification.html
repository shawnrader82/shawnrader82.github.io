      When an organization asks for a certified copy of a document, California law often prevents the
      notary from certifying the copy directly. Copy certification by document custodian is a workaround:

    <h2>What Is Copy Certification By Document Custodian?</h2>
    <p class="service-detail-lead">
      In California, a notary is usually not allowed to certify copies of documents directly. Instead,
      the person who holds the original document signs a sworn statement that the copy is accurate, and
      the notary notarizes that statement with a jurat.
    </p>

    <div class="service-detail-grid">
      <div>
        <h3>How It Differs From A Certified Copy</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>With a traditional certified copy, the notary personally certifies that the copy matches the original.</li>
          <li>With copy certification by document custodian, the notary does not certify the copy.</li>
          <li>Instead, the document custodian signs a statement that the copy is true, correct, and complete.</li>
          <li>The notary notarizes the custodian's signature on that statement using a jurat.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h3>Why It Is Used In California</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>California notaries can directly certify copies of very few documents (mainly powers of attorney).</li>
          <li>For most other documents, state law does not allow the notary to certify the copy.</li>
          <li>Copy certification by document custodian is a widely used alternative that stays within California law while still providing a sworn statement about the copy.</li>
          <li>Many banks, employers, schools, and foreign authorities accept this method, but you should always confirm with the requesting party.</li>

    <h2>Documents Commonly Handled With Copy Certification By Document Custodian</h2>
    <p class="service-detail-lead">
      This method is often used when you need to provide a copy of an important document but cannot
      obtain an official certified copy from the issuing agency, or when the organization simply asks
      for a "certified copy" and accepts this alternative.
    </p>

    <div class="service-detail-grid">
      <div>
        <h3>Frequently Requested Copies</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Passports and driver licenses (for employers, banks, or foreign authorities).</li>
          <li>State ID cards, immigration documents, and residency cards.</li>
          <li>Diplomas, transcripts, and school records when the school will not issue a new certified copy in time.</li>
          <li>Professional licenses, certifications, and membership cards.</li>
          <li>Business documents such as contracts, invoices, and corporate records.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h3>Important Limitations</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Not suitable for vital records such as birth, marriage, or death certificates. Those must come from the issuing agency.</li>
          <li>Not suitable for court-certified copies or other official public records where the agency must provide its own certified copy.</li>
          <li>Always check with the requesting party to confirm they will accept copy certification by document custodian.</li>

    <div class="service-detail-grid">
      <div>
        <h3>At Your Appointment</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>You, as the document custodian, bring the original document and the copy (or we can make the copy on-site).</li>
          <li>The notary provides or attaches a "Copy Certification by Document Custodian" statement, or you bring one provided by your organization.</li>
          <li>You carefully compare the copy to the original and confirm that it is true, correct, and complete.</li>
          <li>You sign the statement in front of the notary.</li>
          <li>The notary administers an oath or affirmation and completes a jurat notarization on the statement.</li>
        </ol>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h3>What The Notary Does And Does Not Do</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>The notary verifies your identity and witnesses you sign the statement.</li>
          <li>The notary administers an oath or affirmation and completes the jurat certificate.</li>
          <li>The notary does not certify the copy directly or guarantee the contents of the underlying document.</li>
          <li>The notary does not decide whether this method will be accepted by the organization that requested the copy.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </div>

    <p style="font-size:12px; color:var(--text-muted); margin-top:20px; line-height:1.5;">
      <strong>Note:</strong> If the requesting party specifically asks for an official certified copy
      from the issuing agency, a copy certification by document custodian will not replace that. It is
      most useful when they are willing to accept a sworn statement about the copy instead.

    <h2>Copy Certification By Document Custodian FAQ</h2>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3>What is copy certification by document custodian?</h3>
      <p>
        It is a process where the holder of the original document signs a sworn statement that a copy is
        true, correct, and complete, and the notary notarizes that statement with a jurat. The notary
        does not certify the copy directly.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3>Why is this method used in California?</h3>
      <p>
        California law heavily limits when notaries can directly certify copies. For most documents,
        the notary may not certify the copy. Copy certification by document custodian provides an
        alternative that keeps the notary within the law while still giving you a sworn statement about
        the copy.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3>What documents can I use this for?</h3>
      <p>
        Common examples include copies of passports, driver licenses, ID cards, diplomas, school
        records, professional licenses, and many other personal or business documents, as long as the
        requesting party is willing to accept a custodian certification.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3>What documents are not appropriate for this?</h3>
      <p>
        Vital records such as birth, marriage, and death certificates, and many court or public records,
        must come from the issuing agency. Those agencies provide their own certified copies and do not
        accept substitute certifications.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3>What type of notarization is used?</h3>
      <p>
        Copy certification by document custodian uses a jurat. You sign a statement about the copy, the
        notary administers an oath or affirmation, and then notarizes your signature.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3>Can I get this done the same day?</h3>
      <p>
        Same-day and next-day appointments are frequently available. Call or text
        <a href="tel:12139332507">(213) 933-2507</a> to check availability.
