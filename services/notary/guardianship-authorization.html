    <h2>What Is A Guardianship Or Temporary Custody Authorization?</h2>
    <p class="service-detail-lead">
      A guardianship or temporary custody authorization is a document that lets a parent or legal guardian
      give another trusted adult temporary authority to care for a minor child. It covers everyday
      decisions like school pickup, medical care, and emergency situations without going through the
      court system.
    </p>

    <div class="service-detail-grid">
      <div>
        <h3>What It Typically Authorizes</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Picking up and dropping off the child at school or daycare.</li>
          <li>Consenting to routine or emergency medical and dental treatment.</li>
          <li>Making day-to-day care decisions for the child.</li>
          <li>Traveling with the child, if travel is included in the authorization.</li>
          <li>Enrolling the child in school or extracurricular activities.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h3>What It Does Not Do</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>It does not permanently transfer custody or parental rights.</li>
          <li>It does not replace a court-appointed guardianship for long-term situations.</li>
          <li>It may not satisfy every institution, though notarization greatly increases acceptance.</li>
          <li>It does not override existing custody orders from a court.</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="margin-top:12px; font-size:13px; color:var(--text-muted);">
          For long-term or permanent guardianship, a court petition is required. This document is for
          temporary, voluntary arrangements between the parent and a trusted caregiver.

        <h3>Temporary Guardianship Authorization</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>A voluntary agreement between the parent and a temporary guardian.</li>
          <li>Covers a specific time period and lists the powers granted to the guardian.</li>

          <li>The basic version does not legally require notarization, but schools and medical providers often prefer a notarized copy.</li>

          <li>The notary completes the notarial certificate for each signature, either an acknowledgment or jurat depending on the document language.</li>
          <li>Each signer signs in the presence of the notary.</li>
          <li>The notary applies their seal, records the notarization in their journal, and provides the completed document.</li>

      <strong>Note:</strong> The notary does not evaluate whether the guardianship arrangement is
      appropriate or legally sufficient for your situation. If you have questions about custody law,
      consult a family law attorney.

    <h2>Guardianship And Temporary Custody Authorization FAQ</h2>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3>What is a temporary guardianship authorization?</h3>
      <p>
        A temporary guardianship authorization is a document that allows a parent or legal guardian to
        give another adult temporary authority to care for a minor child. It typically covers school
        pickup, medical decisions, emergency situations, and day-to-day care.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3>Does a temporary guardianship authorization need to be notarized in California?</h3>
      <p>
        Notarization is not always legally required for every type of guardianship authorization.
        However, it is strongly recommended because schools, hospitals, and other organizations are far
        more likely to accept a notarized version. Some specific forms, like the California Caregiver
        Authorization Affidavit, do not require notarization by law, but a notarized copy provides
        stronger assurance.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3>What is the difference between a temporary guardianship authorization and a court-appointed guardianship?</h3>
      <p>
        A temporary guardianship authorization is a voluntary document signed by the parent. It does not
        require a court hearing and is limited in scope and duration. A court-appointed guardianship is a
        formal legal process that grants broader and longer-term authority to a guardian through the
        court system.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3>Do both parents need to sign?</h3>
      <p>
        If both parents share legal custody of the child, it is best for both to sign. If only one
        parent has sole legal custody, that parent can sign alone with documentation of their custody
        status. Having both signatures reduces the chance that the document will be questioned.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3>Can a mobile notary help me create a temporary guardianship authorization?</h3>
      <p>
        We bring a laptop, portable printer, and scanner. You can use Rocket Lawyer or any legal
        document platform to create a temporary guardianship authorization on the spot, then sign and
        notarize it in one visit. The notary does not provide legal advice.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3>Can I get a guardianship authorization notarized the same day?</h3>
      <p>
        Yes. Same-day and next-day appointments are frequently available. Many guardianship situations
        are time-sensitive, and we prioritize getting to you quickly.
