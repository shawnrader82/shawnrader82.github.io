    <h2>What Is the DS-3053 Statement of Consent?</h2>
    <p class="service-detail-lead">
      The DS-3053 is an official U.S. Department of State form used when one parent or guardian cannot
      be present at a passport acceptance facility to apply for a passport for a child under 16. By
      signing the form and having it notarized, the non-present parent confirms they consent to the
      passport being issued.
    </p>

    <div class="service-detail-grid">
      <div>
        <h3>When You Need a DS-3053</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Only one parent can attend the child's passport appointment in person.</li>
          <li>The other parent is living in a different city, state, or country.</li>
          <li>The parents are divorced or separated and share legal custody.</li>
          <li>A legal guardian cannot attend the appointment but still needs to consent.</li>
          <li>The non-present parent has work, military, or travel commitments that prevent them from going.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h3>When You Do Not Use DS-3053</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>If both parents or all legal guardians can appear in person at the passport office.</li>
          <li>If one parent has sole legal custody and can show documentation of that custody.</li>
          <li>If a parent is unavailable and cannot consent, other special procedures apply instead.</li>
          <li>If you are only authorizing travel, not passport issuance, you use a travel consent letter instead.</li>

    <h2>How DS-3053 Notarization Works</h2>
    <p class="service-detail-lead">
      The DS-3053 has a built in notarial section. It must be signed in front of a notary and completed
      correctly or the passport agency will reject it.

      <div>
        <h3>Step by Step</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Download the current DS-3053 form from the official U.S. Department of State website.</li>
          <li>Fill in the child's information and the required parent or guardian details, but do not sign yet.</li>
          <li>Meet the mobile notary at your home, office, or another convenient location.</li>
          <li>Present valid, current government issued photo ID that matches the name on the form.</li>
          <li>Sign the DS-3053 in front of the notary, who will complete the notarial section and apply their seal.</li>

        <h3>Important Requirements</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>The DS-3053 must be signed in the presence of a notary, not beforehand.</li>
          <li>The name on the ID must match the name of the parent or guardian on the form.</li>
          <li>The form must be printed and completed in black ink, following the State Department instructions.</li>
          <li>The completed form is generally valid for 90 days from the notarization date.</li>

    <h2>DS-3053 Passport Consent Notarization FAQ</h2>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3>What is the DS-3053 form used for?</h3>
      <p>
        The DS-3053 Statement of Consent is used when one parent or guardian cannot appear in person at
        a passport acceptance facility to apply for a passport for a child under 16. By signing and
        notarizing the form, the non-present parent consents to the passport being issued.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3>Does the DS-3053 form have to be notarized?</h3>
      <p>
        Yes. The DS-3053 must be signed in front of a notary public. The notary completes the notarial
        section on the form, confirming your identity and that you swore or affirmed the information is
        true.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3>How long is the DS-3053 valid after notarization?</h3>
      <p>
        The DS-3053 is generally valid for 90 days from the date it is signed and notarized. The passport
        agency may reject a form that is older than that, so complete it close to your child's passport
        appointment.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3>Who needs to be present when notarizing a DS-3053?</h3>
      <p>
        Only the parent or guardian who is signing the DS-3053 needs to be present at the notary
        appointment. The child and the other parent do not need to attend the notarization.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3>What identification is required to notarize a DS-3053?</h3>
      <p>
        You must present valid, current government issued photo ID, such as a drivers license, state ID
        card, or passport. The name on your ID should match the name listed on the DS-3053 form.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3>Can a mobile notary help me fill out the DS-3053?</h3>
      <p>
        A notary cannot provide legal advice or tell you what to write, but we can bring a laptop so you
        can access the latest version of the form on the State Department website, complete it yourself,
        and then sign and notarize it in the same visit.
