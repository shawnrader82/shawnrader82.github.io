    <h2>Time-Sensitive Documents That Cannot Wait</h2>

    <div class="service-detail-grid">
      <div>
        <p class="service-detail-lead">
          When a family member, attorney, or business partner needs a signature from someone in custody,
          there is usually a deadline involved — real estate closings, court filings, power of attorney
          authorizations, or urgent family matters that cannot wait until release.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Powers of attorney so a spouse, family member, or attorney can act on the signer's behalf</li>
          <li>Real estate documents including deeds, refinancing paperwork, and property transfers</li>
          <li>Court filings, affidavits, and declarations for pending legal matters</li>
          <li>Divorce and child custody documents that require both parties' signatures</li>
          <li>Vehicle title transfers and DMV paperwork</li>
          <li>Financial and business authorizations, including bank and investment account forms</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h3>What makes jail notarizations challenging</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Strict facility schedules — visiting hours, lockdowns, and security procedures vary by jail and can change with little notice</li>
          <li>Photo ID requirements — inmates may or may not have valid ID on file, and some facilities have their own identification verification procedures</li>
          <li>Coordination with attorneys, family members, escrow officers, and courts who all need the signed documents by specific deadlines</li>
          <li>Limited communication — the person in custody often cannot easily call, email, or review documents ahead of time</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="font-size:13px; color:var(--text-muted); margin-top:10px;">
          We handle the logistics so you can focus on getting the documents prepared and where they need to go.

      <div>
        <p class="service-detail-lead">
          Jail notarizations require additional travel, coordination, and time compared to standard

        </p>
        <ul>

          <li>Price includes travel to the facility, coordination, wait time, and notarization of documents</li>
          <li>Additional notarizations at the same appointment may be added for a reduced per-signature fee</li>

    <h2>Jail Notary FAQs</h2>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3>Can an inmate sign legal documents?</h3>
      <p>
        Yes. Being in custody does not remove a person's legal right to sign documents. As long as
        the signer is mentally competent, willing to sign, and can provide satisfactory identification,
        a notary can notarize their signature just like any other signing.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3>What ID does the inmate need?</h3>
      <p>
        Acceptable ID typically includes a valid driver's license, state ID, passport, or other
        government-issued photo ID. Some facilities can provide inmate identification verification
        through their booking records. We confirm ID options with you before the appointment.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3>Can I be present at the appointment?</h3>
      <p>
        This depends on the facility's rules. In most cases, professional notary visits are conducted
        separately from regular visitation. If you need to be present (for example, if both spouses
        must sign), we can check whether the facility allows this.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3>How far in advance should I schedule?</h3>
      <p>
        Ideally, give us at least 24–48 hours notice so we can coordinate with the facility. However,
        we understand jail notarizations are often urgent. Call or text as soon as you know you need
        the appointment, and we will do our best to accommodate your timeline.

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3>What if the inmate is transferred or released before the appointment?</h3>
      <p>
        If we arrive at the facility and the inmate is no longer there, you may still be responsible
        for a trip fee. To reduce that risk, we recommend confirming the inmate's location close to the
        appointment time, especially if transfer or release is possible.

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3>Do you notarize documents for federal detention facilities?</h3>
      <p>
        Federal facilities have different procedures and may require additional clearances. Contact us
        with the specific facility name and we can advise whether we can assist.
