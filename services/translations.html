        <div>
          <p class="service-detail-lead">
            Many translation requests are tied to immigration filings, school admissions, licensing, and
            cross-border legal or business matters. Having the right certification wording and format avoids
            last-minute delays when your documents are reviewed.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Birth, marriage, and death certificates for immigration and consular use.</li>
            <li>School diplomas, transcripts, and academic records for foreign schools or licensing boards.</li>
            <li>Powers of attorney, court records, contracts, and other legal documents.</li>
            <li>Business letters, corporate records, and supporting documents used outside the United States.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3>Certified vs. simple translations</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Certified translations include a signed translator's declaration that is typically required for
              immigration, court, and many government uses.
            </li>
            <li>
              Simple or non-certified translations may be suitable for internal business use or informal review,
              but are usually not accepted by agencies or consulates.
            </li>
            <li>
              If you are unsure which level is required, requirements from the requesting agency can be reviewed
              before your project is started.

      <h2>Translation, Notarization, and Apostille Step by Step</h2>

      <div class="service-detail-grid">
        <div>
          <h3>1. Share your documents</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Send clear scans or PDFs of your documents and confirm the languages involved.</li>
            <li>Let us know where the documents will be used (for example, USCIS, a consulate, a foreign school, or a court).</li>
            <li>If you have a deadline or appointment date, share that timing up front.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>2. Estimate and timeline</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Documents are reviewed and an estimate is provided based on length, language pair, and complexity.</li>
            <li>You receive an approximate turnaround time; rush options may be available for some projects.</li>
            <li>Work begins once you approve the estimate and confirm how you would like to receive the finished documents.</li>

        <div>
          <h3>3. Certification and add-on services</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Translations are prepared by a professional, certified translation partner with a signed statement of accuracy.</li>
            <li>When required, notarization of the translator's declaration can be arranged.</li>
            <li>If the documents will be used outside the United States, apostille or legalization can often be coordinated as a follow-up step.</li>

      <h2>Translation FAQs</h2>

      <div class="faq-block">
        <p class="faq-question">Do you personally translate the documents?</p>
        <p class="faq-answer">
          Translations are handled by a professional, certified translation partner, and we coordinate the
          process so you have a single point of contact for translation, notarization, and apostille when needed.
        </p>

        <p class="faq-question">What languages can you arrange?</p>
        <p class="faq-answer">
          Coordination is available for many common language pairs used for immigration, academic, and business
          purposes. You can call or text with your language combination and destination country to confirm availability.
        </p>

        <p class="faq-question">How is pricing for translation determined?</p>
        <p class="faq-answer">
          Translation is typically priced per page or per word based on the document type, language pair, and
          complexity. Your documents are reviewed first, then a clear estimate is provided before any work begins.
        </p>

        <p class="faq-question">Can translation be combined with apostille or notary services?</p>
        <p class="faq-answer">
          Yes. Many clients need both translation and apostille or notarization. These steps can be coordinated
          together so your final documents are translated, certified, and prepared for where they will be used.
