    <h2>Visiting Cois M. Byrd Detention Center for a Wedding</h2>
    <p class="service-detail-lead">
      Cois M. Byrd Detention Center is in the French Valley area between Murrieta and Temecula, just off the I-15. The drive from LA is straightforward but the I-15 through Temecula can be brutal on weekends.
    </p>
    <div class="service-detail-grid">
      <div>
        <h3>Directions &amp; Parking</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Address:</strong> 30755-B Auld Rd, Murrieta, CA 92563 — in French Valley, east of the I-15.</li>
          <li><strong>From LA:</strong> Take the I-15 South through Corona and Lake Elsinore. Exit at Clinton Keith Rd or Auld Rd and head east. The facility is approximately 1 mile from the freeway. Allow 90 minutes to 2 hours from downtown LA.</li>
          <li><strong>From Temecula:</strong> Take the I-15 North to Auld Rd. Head east. The facility is on the left.</li>
          <li><strong>Parking:</strong> Free visitor parking on-site. The lot is spacious and rarely fills up.</li>
          <li><strong>Rideshare:</strong> Uber/Lyft can drop off at the visitor entrance. Rideshare availability in French Valley is moderate — confirm your return ride before going through security.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>What to Know Before Check&#8209;In</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Scheduling:</strong> Visits must be scheduled one day in advance by calling (951) 696-3060 between 9:00 AM and 5:00 PM.</li>
          <li><strong>Visiting hours:</strong> Two visits per week per inmate, each approximately 45 minutes. Hours vary by housing assignment — confirm when scheduling.</li>
          <li><strong>Bring only:</strong> Valid government-issued photo ID and your car key. All other personal items stay in your vehicle.</li>
          <li><strong>Leave in your car:</strong> Cell phones, purses, bags, cameras, food, drink, and all electronics.</li>
          <li><strong>Arrive early:</strong> Plan to arrive 30 minutes before your scheduled visit to clear security screening.</li>
          <li><strong>Dress code:</strong> Clothing must cover upper torso and lower/mid body. No gang-affiliated, sexual, lewd, or offensive imagery. Skirts must reach at least mid-thigh.</li>
        </ul>

      Here&#39;s what to expect on ceremony day so there are no surprises.
    </p>
    <div class="service-detail-grid">
      <div>
        <h3>The Visiting Room</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Ceremonies take place in the regular visiting area — there is no private chapel or ceremony room.</li>
          <li>Visits are approximately 45 minutes. Our officiant keeps the ceremony focused and meaningful within this window.</li>
          <li>The visiting format depends on the inmate’s housing assignment and classification.</li>
          <li>A maximum of two adults and two children are allowed per visit, including your required witness.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>Plan Your Day</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Total time on-site:</strong> Plan for 2 to 3 hours from parking to leaving. Security screening takes the bulk of the time beyond the ceremony itself.</li>
          <li><strong>No items exchanged:</strong> Rings, gifts, documents, or any physical items cannot be passed to the inmate during the visit.</li>
          <li><strong>No photography:</strong> No cameras, phones, or recording devices are allowed inside the facility.</li>
          <li><strong>Dress code:</strong> Dress modestly. Clothing must cover upper torso and lower body. No gang references, offensive imagery, or revealing clothing.</li>
          <li><strong>I-15 weekend traffic:</strong> The I-15 through Corona and Temecula is one of the most congested weekend corridors in Southern California. If your ceremony is on a Saturday or Sunday, leave early or consider taking the 15 to the 215 bypass through Perris to avoid the worst of it.</li>
