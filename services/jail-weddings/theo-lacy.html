      <div>
        <h3>Directions &amp; Parking</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Address:</strong> 501 The City Dr S, Orange, CA 92868 — near the intersection of The City Drive and Chapman Ave.</li>
          <li><strong>From LA:</strong> Take the 5 South to the 22 East. Exit at City Drive South. The facility is on your left. Allow 30 to 60 minutes from downtown LA depending on traffic.</li>
          <li><strong>From South OC:</strong> Take the 5 North to The City Drive exit. The facility is approximately half a mile from the freeway.</li>
          <li><strong>Parking:</strong> Free visitor parking lot on-site. The lot is generally manageable, but arrive early on weekends when visiting traffic peaks.</li>
          <li><strong>Rideshare:</strong> Uber/Lyft can drop off at the visitor entrance on The City Drive South.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>The Visiting Room</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Ceremonies take place in the regular visiting area — there is no private chapel or ceremony room.</li>
          <li>Visits are typically 30 minutes. Our officiant keeps the ceremony focused and meaningful within this window.</li>
          <li>The visiting format (glass partition or face-to-face) depends on the inmate's housing assignment and classification.</li>
          <li>Visits are limited to two adults and two minors, including your required witness.</li>

      <div>
        <h3>Plan Your Day</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Total time on-site:</strong> Plan for 2 to 3 hours from parking to leaving. Security screening and processing take the bulk of the time, even though the ceremony itself fits within a 30-minute visit.</li>
          <li><strong>No items exchanged:</strong> Rings, gifts, documents, or any physical items cannot be passed to the inmate during the visit.</li>
          <li><strong>No photography:</strong> No cameras, phones, or recording devices are allowed inside the facility.</li>
          <li><strong>Dress code:</strong> Dress modestly. Avoid clothing resembling inmate uniforms (solid orange). No revealing clothing, open-toed shoes, or clothing with offensive imagery.</li>
          <li><strong>Nearby amenities:</strong> The Block at Orange shopping center is across the street — a convenient spot to wait or grab food before or after your visit.</li>
