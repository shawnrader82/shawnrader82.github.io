          <span class="jw-facility-detail-label">Guest policy:</span>

          <span>East Valley Jail holds roughly 100 inmates and is co-located with the East County Patrol Station. Because of its smaller size, inmates housed here for extended periods are less common &mdash; many are transferred to the Main Jail or Todd Road. Confirm your partner&rsquo;s location before planning the visit. The facility is close to the 101/23 interchange, making it the easiest Ventura County jail to reach from the San Fernando Valley.</span>

          <li><strong>From the 101:</strong> Exit at Wendy Drive / Olsen Road. Head north on Olsen Road. The patrol station and jail will be on your left.</li>
          <li><strong>From the 23:</strong> Take the 23 south to the 101 west, then follow the 101 directions above. Or exit Olsen Road directly if coming from the north.</li>
          <li><strong>From the San Fernando Valley:</strong> Take the 101 west through Calabasas and Agoura Hills &mdash; roughly 35 to 45 minutes from Woodland Hills.</li>

          <li><strong>Arrive early:</strong> Check in at least one hour before the posted visiting time. The facility is small, so check-in is usually faster than at larger jails.</li>

          <li><strong>No photography:</strong> No cameras, phones, or recording devices allowed inside.</li>
