    <h2>Visiting High Desert Detention Center for a Wedding</h2>
    <p class="service-detail-lead">
      High Desert Detention Center is in Adelanto, deep in the High Desert north of San Bernardino. This is the most remote facility in SB County — plan your trip carefully.
    </p>
    <div class="service-detail-grid">
      <div>
        <h3>Directions &amp; Parking</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Address:</strong> 9438 Commerce Way, Adelanto, CA 92301 — off US-395 in the Victor Valley area.</li>
          <li><strong>From LA:</strong> Take I-15 North through the Cajon Pass. Exit at US-395 North toward Adelanto. Turn left on Air Expressway, then right on Commerce Way. Allow 90 minutes to 2 hours from downtown LA without traffic.</li>
          <li><strong>Parking:</strong> Free visitor parking on-site. The lot rarely fills up.</li>
          <li><strong>Rideshare:</strong> Rideshare availability in Adelanto is limited. We strongly recommend driving yourself or arranging transportation in advance.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>What to Know Before Check&#8209;In</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Scheduling:</strong> Visits must be scheduled in advance through the San Bernardino County Sheriff’s visitor system.</li>
          <li><strong>Visiting hours:</strong> Vary by housing unit. Confirm your specific schedule before making the drive.</li>
          <li><strong>Bring only:</strong> Valid government-issued photo ID and your car key. Everything else stays in your vehicle.</li>
          <li><strong>Leave in your car:</strong> Cell phones, purses, bags, cameras, food, and all electronics.</li>
          <li><strong>Weather:</strong> The High Desert is extremely hot in summer (110°F+) and cold in winter. Dress for the weather — you may wait outside during processing.</li>
          <li><strong>Gas up before you go:</strong> Fill your tank before leaving the I-15. Gas stations are sparse near the facility.</li>

        <h3>The Visiting Room</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Ceremonies take place in the regular visiting area — there is no private chapel or ceremony room.</li>
          <li>Visit times are managed by the facility and may be shorter than at larger SB County jails. Our officiant keeps the ceremony clear and meaningful.</li>
          <li>The visiting format depends on the inmate’s housing assignment and classification.</li>
          <li>Guest counts are strictly limited. Typically only the spouse, one witness, and the officiant are permitted.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>Plan Your Day</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Total time on-site:</strong> Plan for 2 to 3 hours at the facility itself. Add 3 to 4 hours of round-trip driving from LA.</li>
          <li><strong>No items exchanged:</strong> Rings, gifts, documents, or any physical items cannot be passed to the inmate during the visit.</li>
          <li><strong>No photography:</strong> No cameras, phones, or recording devices are allowed inside.</li>
          <li><strong>Dress code:</strong> Dress modestly. Avoid solid blue or orange clothing. No revealing clothing, open-toed shoes, or offensive imagery.</li>
          <li><strong>Not the ICE facility:</strong> There is a separate ICE processing center in Adelanto. Make sure you navigate to 9438 Commerce Way — the San Bernardino County Sheriff’s facility.</li>
