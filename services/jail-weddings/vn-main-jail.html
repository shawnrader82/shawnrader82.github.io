    <h2>Your Wedding at Ventura County Main Jail</h2>
    <p class="service-detail-lead">
      Here&#39;s what to expect on ceremony day so there are no surprises.
    </p>
    <div class="service-detail-grid">
      <div>
        <h3>The Visiting Room</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Ceremonies take place in the same visiting area used for regular public visits &mdash; there is no dedicated chapel or private room.</li>
          <li>Visits are 30 minutes. We design the ceremony to fit comfortably within that window while still feeling meaningful.</li>
          <li>Depending on classification and housing, visits may be behind glass or face&#8209;to&#8209;face at a table; the facility decides the format.</li>
          <li>You may have up to two visitors (for example, you and your witness, or you, a witness, and a minor if current policy allows).</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>Plan Your Day</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Total time on-site:</strong> Expect 2 to 3 hours from parking to departure. Security screening and waiting for your visiting turn take the most time.</li>
          <li><strong>No items exchanged:</strong> Rings, gifts, letters, or any other items cannot be passed to the inmate during the ceremony.</li>
          <li><strong>No photography:</strong> Cameras and phones are not allowed inside the visiting area, and staff will not take photos.</li>
          <li><strong>After the wedding:</strong> We file your signed marriage license with the appropriate county recorder. The certified copy usually arrives by mail within several weeks.</li>
          <li><strong>Combine errands:</strong> Because the jail is at the Government Center, some couples use the same trip to handle other county business, such as court or records.</li>
