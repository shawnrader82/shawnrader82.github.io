    <div class="service-detail-kicker">Getting There &amp; Check&#8209;In</div>
    <h2>Visiting James A. Musick Facility for a Wedding</h2>
    <p class="service-detail-lead">
      James A. Musick Facility is in a rural area of Irvine near the 241 toll road. The location is more remote than other OC jails — use GPS and plan your route in advance.
    </p>
    <div class="service-detail-grid">
      <div>
        <h3>Directions &amp; Parking</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Address:</strong> 13502 Musick Rd, Irvine, CA 92618 — east of the 5 freeway, near the 241 toll road.</li>
          <li><strong>From LA:</strong> Take the 5 South toward Irvine. Exit at Sand Canyon Ave and head east toward Musick Rd. The facility is approximately 2 miles from the freeway. Allow 45 to 75 minutes from downtown LA.</li>
          <li><strong>From South OC:</strong> Take the 5 North or 241 toll road. Exit at Portola Parkway or Sand Canyon Ave and follow signs to Musick Rd.</li>
          <li><strong>Parking:</strong> Free visitor parking on-site at the check-in bungalow. The lot rarely fills up.</li>
          <li><strong>Rideshare:</strong> Uber/Lyft can drop off at the visitor check-in bungalow. The area is somewhat remote, so confirm your return ride in advance.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>What to Know Before Check&#8209;In</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Scheduling:</strong> Visits are scheduled on-site. Sign-ups are accepted from 7:00 AM to 5:00 PM during visiting days. No advance phone scheduling is required, but arrive early to secure your spot.</li>
          <li><strong>Visiting hours:</strong> Friday through Monday, 8:00 AM to 6:00 PM. Last sign-up at 5:00 PM.</li>
          <li><strong>Bring only:</strong> Valid government-issued photo ID and your car key. You'll check these in at the visitor bungalow and receive a visitor's pass.</li>
          <li><strong>Leave in your car:</strong> Cell phones, purses, bags, cameras, food, and all electronics. There are no lockers — everything stays in your vehicle.</li>
          <li><strong>Shuttle bus:</strong> After check-in at the bungalow, you'll take a shuttle bus to the visiting center. Buses run approximately every 15 minutes. Factor this into your timing.</li>
        </ul>

      Here&#39;s what to expect on ceremony day so there are no surprises.

    <div class="service-detail-grid">
      <div>
        <h3>The Visiting Room</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Ceremonies take place in the visiting center — not behind glass. Musick uses open bench seating where you sit across from the inmate, making it a more personal ceremony setting.</li>
          <li>Visits are 30 minutes. Our officiant keeps the ceremony focused and meaningful within this window.</li>
          <li>Physical contact with inmates is not permitted, even in the open seating environment.</li>
          <li>Visits are limited to two adults and one child, including your required witness.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>Plan Your Day</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Total time on-site:</strong> Plan for 2 to 3 hours from parking to leaving. The shuttle ride and check-in process add time beyond the ceremony itself.</li>
          <li><strong>No items exchanged:</strong> Rings, gifts, documents, or any physical items cannot be passed to the inmate during the visit.</li>
          <li><strong>No photography:</strong> No cameras, phones, or recording devices are allowed inside the facility.</li>
          <li><strong>Dress code:</strong> Dress modestly. Avoid clothing resembling inmate uniforms (solid orange). No revealing clothing, open-toed shoes, or clothing with offensive imagery.</li>
          <li><strong>More personal setting:</strong> Musick's open bench visiting area is more intimate than the glass partition visits at Theo Lacy or Central Jail. Many couples prefer this environment for their ceremony.</li>
