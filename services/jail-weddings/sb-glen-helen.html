      <div>
        <div class="jw-facility-detail-row">
          <span class="jw-facility-detail-label">Approval process:</span>
          <span>Marriage requests are submitted through the San Bernardino County Sheriff&#39;s Department. Allow 2 to 4 weeks for processing and approval, depending on housing unit and caseload.</span>
        </div>
        <div class="jw-facility-detail-row">
          <span class="jw-facility-detail-label">Ceremony setting:</span>
          <span>Ceremonies take place during regular visiting hours in the standard visiting area. There is no private chapel or dedicated ceremony room at Glen Helen; you share space with other scheduled visits.</span>
        </div>
        <div class="jw-facility-detail-row">
          <span class="jw-facility-detail-label">Guest policy:</span>
          <span>One witness with valid government&#8209;issued photo ID is required for the marriage license. Visitor capacity beyond the spouse and witness is limited and depends on current facility rules; most ceremonies are kept to a small group.</span>
        </div>
        <div class="jw-facility-detail-row">
          <span class="jw-facility-detail-label">Visiting hours:</span>
          <span>Visiting hours vary by housing assignment and may include weekends. We confirm the specific visiting blocks for your partner&#39;s unit with the facility so your ceremony is set during an approved time.</span>
        </div>
        <div class="jw-facility-detail-row">
          <span class="jw-facility-detail-label">Items allowed:</span>
          <span>No items may be exchanged during the ceremony, including rings. As with other San Bernardino County jails, cameras, phones, and recording devices are not allowed past security; only your ID, car key, and authorized paperwork may enter.</span>
        </div>
        <div class="jw-facility-detail-row">
          <span class="jw-facility-detail-label">Good to know:</span>
          <span>Glen Helen sits in the Devore area near Glen Helen Regional Park and the Glen Helen Amphitheater. Event days can bring heavy traffic on Glen Helen Parkway, so it&#39;s smart to check the concert schedule and build in extra drive time.</span>

    <h2>Visiting Glen Helen Rehabilitation Center for a Wedding</h2>
    <p class="service-detail-lead">
      Glen Helen Rehabilitation Center sits in the Devore area of San Bernardino County, near where the I&#8209;15 and
      I&#8209;215 merge. The location is semi&#8209;rural &mdash; don&#39;t rely on last&#8209;minute navigation.
    </p>
    <div class="service-detail-grid">
      <div>
        <h3>Directions &amp; Parking</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Address:</strong> 18000 Institution Rd, San Bernardino, CA 92407 &mdash; off Glen Helen Parkway in the Devore area.</li>
          <li><strong>From LA:</strong> Take the I&#8209;10 East to I&#8209;15 North. Exit at Glen Helen Parkway, then follow signs to Institution Road. The facility entrance is approximately 1 mile from the freeway exit.</li>
          <li><strong>Parking:</strong> Free visitor parking on&#8209;site. The lot is generally less crowded than West Valley but can back up on event days.</li>
          <li><strong>Rideshare:</strong> Uber/Lyft can drop off at the visitor entrance. Cell service can be spotty, so arrange your return ride in advance or plan to call from the parking lot, not after you are inside.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>What to Know Before Check&#8209;In</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Scheduling:</strong> Visits must be scheduled in advance through the San Bernardino County Sheriff&#39;s visitor system. We help you navigate the options for your housing unit.</li>
          <li><strong>Visiting hours:</strong> Vary by housing unit and program status, often Thursday through Sunday. We confirm your exact window before you travel.</li>
          <li><strong>Bring only:</strong> Valid government&#8209;issued photo ID and your car key. Everything else stays in your vehicle unless specifically approved.</li>
          <li><strong>Leave in your car:</strong> Cell phones, purses, wallets, bags, cameras, food, and all electronics.</li>
          <li><strong>Arrive early:</strong> Plan to arrive 30&ndash;45 minutes before your scheduled visit to clear security and check in without stress.</li>

          <li><strong>No photography:</strong> Cameras, phones, and recording devices are not allowed inside the facility.</li>
