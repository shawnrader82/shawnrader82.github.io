        <h3>Directions &amp; Parking</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Address:</strong> 535 N Alameda St, Los Angeles, CA 90012 &#8212; in downtown Los Angeles near Union Station, just off the 101 freeway.</li>
          <li><strong>From the 101:</strong> Exit at Alameda Street. The facility is on the east side of Alameda between Aliso Street and the 101.</li>
          <li><strong>Parking:</strong> Limited visitor parking near the facility. Paid lots and metered street parking are available in the area. Downtown parking fills up &#8212; arrive early.</li>

        <h3>What to Know Before Check&#8209;In</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Federal facility:</strong> MDC is operated by the Bureau of Prisons, not the county sheriff. Check-in procedures, screening, and visiting rules are all federal and differ from county jails.</li>

          <li><strong>Advance approval required:</strong> Unlike county jails, you cannot simply show up for a wedding visit. All arrangements must be approved through the BOP process ahead of time.</li>
          <li><strong>Bring only:</strong> Valid government&#8209;issued photo ID. Leave everything else in your car &#8212; no phones, electronics, bags, or outside items.</li>

    <h2>Your Wedding at MDC</h2>
    <p class="service-detail-lead">
      MDC is a federal facility, which means ceremony logistics differ from county jails in several important ways.
    </p>
    <div class="service-detail-grid">
      <div>
        <h3>The Visiting Room</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Ceremonies take place during approved visiting periods. No private ceremony room is available.</li>
          <li>Visiting time and format are determined by the Bureau of Prisons and may be more limited than at county facilities.</li>
          <li>The visiting format &#8212; glass partition or contact &#8212; depends on the inmate&#39;s security classification. Higher&#8209;security inmates are more likely to have glass visits.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>MDC&#8209;Specific Considerations</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Longer approval timeline:</strong> Federal marriage requests require BOP review and typically involve the inmate&#39;s attorney. This process takes significantly longer than county jail requests &#8212; plan accordingly.</li>
          <li><strong>Restricted housing:</strong> Some inmates in restrictive housing may have modified or suspended visiting privileges. Contact us first and we&#39;ll determine feasibility.</li>
          <li><strong>Federal facility:</strong> MDC is completely separate from LASD county jails. Visiting rules, marriage approval, and scheduling are all handled through the Bureau of Prisons.</li>
          <li><strong>No items exchanged:</strong> Rings, gifts, or documents cannot be passed during the visit.</li>
          <li><strong>No photography:</strong> No phones, cameras, or recording devices inside the facility.</li>
          <li><strong>Dress code:</strong> Dress modestly. No solid blue clothing, revealing outfits, open&#8209;toed shoes, or clothing with offensive imagery.</li>
