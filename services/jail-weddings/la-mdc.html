    <p class="service-detail-lead">
      Metropolitan Detention Center is located at 535 N Alameda St in downtown Los Angeles, near Union Station. It is a higher&#8209;security facility with its own visiting rules and procedures.

      <div>
        <h3>Directions &amp; Parking</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Address:</strong> 535 N Alameda St, Los Angeles, CA 90012 &mdash; in downtown Los Angeles near Union Station, just off the 101 freeway.</li>
          <li><strong>From the I&#8209;5:</strong> Exit at The Old Road in downtown Los Angeles. Follow signs for MDC / visitor parking.</li>
          <li><strong>Drive time:</strong> About 40&ndash;50 minutes from downtown LA. Weekend mornings on I&#8209;5 north are generally smooth.</li>
          <li><strong>Parking:</strong> Limited visitor parking nearby. Paid lots and street parking available in the area. Plan ahead for downtown LA parking.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>What to Know Before Check&#8209;In</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Visiting days:</strong> Saturdays and Sundays, 8:00 AM &ndash; 3:00 PM. First come, first served &mdash; no online scheduling.</li>
          <li><strong>Arrive very early:</strong> MDC is a federal facility with strict check-in procedures. Lines can form well before visiting hours. Be in the parking lot by 6:30&ndash;7:00 AM.</li>
          <li><strong>Federal facility:</strong> MDC houses federal inmates. Expect thorough screening and potentially longer processing times than at county jails.</li>
          <li><strong>Visiting restrictions:</strong> Visiting rules may be more restrictive depending on classification. Contact us with the inmate&#39;s booking number and we&#39;ll confirm what&#39;s possible before you make the drive.</li>
          <li><strong>Bring only:</strong> Valid government&#8209;issued photo ID. Leave everything else in your car.</li>
          <li><strong>Plan for 4+ hours total:</strong> Driving, waiting, shuttle, enhanced screening, and the visit itself take most of a morning.</li>

    <h2>Your Wedding at MDC</h2>
    <p class="service-detail-lead">
      MDC is a higher&#8209;security facility, which means ceremony logistics can differ from the general population jails.
    </p>
    <div class="service-detail-grid">
      <div>
        <h3>The Visiting Room</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Ceremonies take place during regular weekend visiting hours. No private ceremony room is available.</li>
          <li>Inmates receive <strong>one hour of visitation per weekend</strong>, split into two 30&#8209;minute sessions.</li>
          <li>Up to <strong>3 visitors</strong> at a time are permitted.</li>
          <li>The visiting format &mdash; glass partition or contact &mdash; depends on the inmate&#39;s security classification. Higher&#8209;security inmates are more likely to have glass visits.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>MDC&#8209;Specific Considerations</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Additional approval steps:</strong> Higher&#8209;security classification may require extra review for marriage requests. This can add time to the approval process &mdash; we factor it in.</li>
          <li><strong>Restricted housing:</strong> Some inmates in restrictive housing may have modified or suspended visiting privileges. Contact us first and we&#39;ll determine feasibility.</li>
          <li><strong>Federal facility:</strong> MDC is a federal Bureau of Prisons facility, completely separate from LASD county jails. Visiting rules, marriage approval, and scheduling are all handled differently.</li>
          <li><strong>No items exchanged:</strong> Rings, gifts, or documents cannot be passed during the visit.</li>
          <li><strong>No photography:</strong> No phones, cameras, or recording devices inside the facility.</li>
          <li><strong>Dress code:</strong> Dress modestly. No solid blue clothing, revealing outfits, open&#8209;toed shoes, or clothing with offensive imagery.</li>
