    <h2>Visiting Pitchess Detention Center for a Wedding</h2>
    <p class="service-detail-lead">
      Pitchess Detention Center — also known as Wayside — is a massive 2,600&#8209;acre complex in Castaic, about 40 minutes north of downtown Los Angeles. The remote location and multi&#8209;facility layout require extra planning.
    </p>
    <div class="service-detail-grid">
      <div>
        <h3>Directions &amp; Parking</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Address:</strong> 29320 The Old Rd, Castaic, CA 91384 — off the I&#8209;5 freeway in Castaic.</li>
          <li><strong>From the I&#8209;5:</strong> Exit at The Old Road in Castaic. The facility entrance is clearly marked. Follow signs for visitor parking.</li>
          <li><strong>Drive time:</strong> About 40–50 minutes from downtown LA without traffic. On weekends, I&#8209;5 north is usually clear in the morning.</li>
          <li><strong>Parking:</strong> Visitor parking is at the Dr. Elmer T. Jafee lot. A shuttle bus runs from the lot to the facility — you do not walk in.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>What to Know Before Check&#8209;In</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Visiting days:</strong> Saturdays and Sundays only, 8:00 AM – 3:00 PM. Visits are <strong>first come, first served</strong> — there is no online scheduling for Pitchess.</li>
          <li><strong>Arrive very early:</strong> Lines form well before 8:00 AM. Some visitors arrive hours ahead of time. Plan to be in the parking lot by 6:30–7:00 AM at the latest.</li>
          <li><strong>Processing time:</strong> After check&#8209;in, you&#39;ll take a shuttle to the facility. The entire process from parking to seated visit can take over an hour.</li>
          <li><strong>Bring only:</strong> Valid government&#8209;issued photo ID. Leave everything else in your car — there may not be lockers at the satellite lot.</li>
          <li><strong>Know the facility area:</strong> Pitchess has North, South, and East housing areas. Confirm which area your partner is housed in before arriving.</li>
          <li><strong>Plan for 4+ hours total:</strong> Between driving, waiting, shuttle, processing, and the visit itself, the Pitchess experience takes most of a morning.</li>
        </ul>

    <div class="service-detail-kicker">What the Ceremony Is Like</div>
    <h2>Your Wedding at Pitchess Detention Center</h2>
    <p class="service-detail-lead">
      Here&#39;s what to expect on ceremony day at Pitchess — the logistics are different from the downtown jails.
    </p>
    <div class="service-detail-grid">
      <div>
        <h3>The Visiting Room</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Ceremonies take place during regular weekend visiting hours in the visiting area of the assigned housing facility.</li>
          <li>Inmates receive <strong>one hour of visitation per weekend</strong>, split into two 30&#8209;minute sessions. The ceremony will use one of these sessions.</li>
          <li>Up to <strong>3 visitors</strong> at a time are permitted. An infant or toddler may not count as a visitor.</li>
          <li>The visiting format depends on the inmate&#39;s housing area and classification level.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>Pitchess&#8209;Specific Considerations</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Weekend&#8209;only visits:</strong> Unlike downtown jails, Pitchess visiting is weekends and select holidays only. This limits ceremony scheduling options.</li>
          <li><strong>County Clerk logistics:</strong> Pitchess is 40+ minutes from the nearest LA County Clerk office. We coordinate the license pickup and ceremony scheduling so you don&#39;t make unnecessary trips.</li>
          <li><strong>Adjacent to NCCF:</strong> If the inmate is at NCCF rather than Pitchess, the visiting procedures are different. Make sure you know which facility — we can help confirm.</li>
          <li><strong>No items exchanged:</strong> Rings, gifts, or documents cannot be passed during the visit.</li>
          <li><strong>No photography:</strong> No phones, cameras, or recording devices inside the facility.</li>
          <li><strong>Dress code:</strong> Dress modestly. No solid blue clothing, revealing outfits, open&#8209;toed shoes, or clothing with offensive imagery.</li>
        </ul>
