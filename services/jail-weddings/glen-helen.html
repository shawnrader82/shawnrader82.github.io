    <h2>Visiting Glen Helen Rehabilitation Center for a Wedding</h2>
    <p class="service-detail-lead">
      Glen Helen Rehabilitation Center sits in the Devore area of San Bernardino County, near where the I-15 and I-215 merge. The location is semi-rural — don&#39;t rely on last-minute navigation.
    </p>
    <div class="service-detail-grid">
      <div>
        <h3>Directions &amp; Parking</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Address:</strong> 18000 Institution Rd, San Bernardino, CA 92407 — off Glen Helen Parkway in the Devore area.</li>
          <li><strong>From LA:</strong> Take the I-10 East to I-15 North. Exit at Glen Helen Parkway, then follow signs to Institution Road. The facility entrance is approximately 1 mile from the freeway exit.</li>
          <li><strong>Parking:</strong> Free visitor parking on-site. The lot is generally not as crowded as West Valley, but arrive early on weekends.</li>
          <li><strong>Rideshare:</strong> Uber/Lyft can drop off at the visitor entrance. Cell service can be spotty in the area, so arrange your return ride in advance.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>What to Know Before Check&#8209;In</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Scheduling:</strong> Visits must be scheduled in advance through the San Bernardino County Sheriff’s visitor system.</li>
          <li><strong>Visiting hours:</strong> Vary by housing unit. Typically available Thursday through Sunday. Confirm before traveling.</li>
          <li><strong>Bring only:</strong> Valid government-issued photo ID and your car key. Everything else stays in your vehicle.</li>
          <li><strong>Leave in your car:</strong> Cell phones, purses, wallets, bags, cameras, food, and all electronics.</li>
          <li><strong>Arrive early:</strong> Plan to arrive 30 to 45 minutes before your visit. The remote location means you can’t easily run back to your car if you forget something.</li>

          <li><strong>No photography:</strong> No cameras, phones, or recording devices are allowed inside the facility.</li>
