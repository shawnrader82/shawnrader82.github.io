    <div class="service-detail-kicker">Getting There &amp; Check&#8209;In</div>
    <h2>Visiting NCCF for a Wedding</h2>
    <p class="service-detail-lead">
      North County Correctional Facility is adjacent to Pitchess Detention Center in Castaic, but operates as a separate higher&#8209;security facility with its own visiting rules.
    </p>
    <div class="service-detail-grid">
      <div>
        <h3>Directions &amp; Parking</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Address:</strong> 29340 The Old Rd, Castaic, CA 91384 — same general complex as Pitchess, but a separate facility entrance.</li>
          <li><strong>From the I&#8209;5:</strong> Exit at The Old Road in Castaic. Follow signs for NCCF / visitor parking.</li>
          <li><strong>Drive time:</strong> About 40–50 minutes from downtown LA. Weekend mornings on I&#8209;5 north are generally smooth.</li>
          <li><strong>Parking:</strong> Visitor parking at the Dr. Elmer T. Jafee lot, same as Pitchess. Shuttle bus available to the facility.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>What to Know Before Check&#8209;In</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Visiting days:</strong> Saturdays and Sundays, 8:00 AM – 3:00 PM. First come, first served — no online scheduling.</li>
          <li><strong>Arrive very early:</strong> NCCF shares the Castaic complex with Pitchess. Lines form well before opening. Be in the parking lot by 6:30–7:00 AM.</li>
          <li><strong>Higher security:</strong> NCCF houses higher&#8209;security inmates. Expect more thorough screening and potentially longer processing times than at Pitchess.</li>
          <li><strong>Visiting restrictions:</strong> Visiting rules may be more restrictive depending on classification. Contact us with the inmate&#39;s booking number and we&#39;ll confirm what&#39;s possible before you make the drive.</li>
          <li><strong>Bring only:</strong> Valid government&#8209;issued photo ID. Leave everything else in your car.</li>
          <li><strong>Plan for 4+ hours total:</strong> Driving, waiting, shuttle, enhanced screening, and the visit itself take most of a morning.</li>

    <div class="service-detail-kicker">What the Ceremony Is Like</div>
    <h2>Your Wedding at NCCF</h2>
    <p class="service-detail-lead">
      NCCF is a higher&#8209;security facility, which means ceremony logistics can differ from the general population jails.
    </p>
    <div class="service-detail-grid">
      <div>
        <h3>The Visiting Room</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Ceremonies take place during regular weekend visiting hours. No private ceremony room is available.</li>
          <li>Inmates receive <strong>one hour of visitation per weekend</strong>, split into two 30&#8209;minute sessions.</li>
          <li>Up to <strong>3 visitors</strong> at a time are permitted.</li>
          <li>The visiting format — glass partition or contact — depends on the inmate&#39;s security classification. Higher&#8209;security inmates are more likely to have glass visits.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>NCCF&#8209;Specific Considerations</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Additional approval steps:</strong> Higher&#8209;security classification may require extra review for marriage requests. This can add time to the approval process — we factor it in.</li>
          <li><strong>Restricted housing:</strong> Some inmates in restrictive housing may have modified or suspended visiting privileges. Contact us first and we&#39;ll determine feasibility.</li>
          <li><strong>Not the same as Pitchess:</strong> Despite sharing the Castaic complex, NCCF and Pitchess are separate facilities with different visiting procedures and approval chains.</li>
          <li><strong>No items exchanged:</strong> Rings, gifts, or documents cannot be passed during the visit.</li>
          <li><strong>No photography:</strong> No phones, cameras, or recording devices inside the facility.</li>
          <li><strong>Dress code:</strong> Dress modestly. No solid blue clothing, revealing outfits, open&#8209;toed shoes, or clothing with offensive imagery.</li>
