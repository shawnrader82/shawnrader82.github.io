    <h2>Visiting Men&#39;s Central Jail for a Wedding</h2>
    <p class="service-detail-lead">
      Men&#39;s Central Jail is in the heart of downtown Los Angeles, just off the 101 freeway. Plan for traffic and arrive early — check&#8209;in takes time.
    </p>
    <div class="service-detail-grid">
      <div>
        <h3>Directions &amp; Parking</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Address:</strong> 441 Bauchet St, Los Angeles, CA 90012 — between Vignes St and Alameda St, directly off the 101.</li>
          <li><strong>From the 101:</strong> Exit at Vignes St, head south. Turn left on Bauchet St. The jail complex is on your right.</li>
          <li><strong>Parking:</strong> Paid parking structure at the corner of Vignes and Bauchet — currently $8.00 per entry. The structure is shared with Twin Towers, so it fills up on weekends. Arrive early.</li>
          <li><strong>Rideshare:</strong> Uber/Lyft can drop off on Bauchet. Have the driver use the Vignes St approach.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>What to Know Before Check&#8209;In</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Scheduling:</strong> Visits must be scheduled in advance through the LASD online visitor system at visit.lasd.org. Walk&#8209;in visits are not guaranteed.</li>
          <li><strong>Visiting hours:</strong> Thursday–Friday 10:00 AM – 7:00 PM, Saturday–Sunday 7:00 AM – 3:00 PM. Hours vary by housing assignment and are subject to change — always confirm before your visit.</li>
          <li><strong>Bring only:</strong> Valid government&#8209;issued photo ID and one key. Everything else goes in a locker. Bring quarters for the lockers — no change machines.</li>
          <li><strong>Leave in your car:</strong> Cell phones, purses, bags, cameras, recording devices, and any electronics. They will not be allowed past security.</li>
          <li><strong>Arrive early:</strong> Plan to arrive at least 45–60 minutes before your scheduled visit to clear security screening.</li>
        </ul>

    <h2>Your Wedding at Men&#39;s Central Jail</h2>

      Here&#39;s what to expect on ceremony day so there are no surprises.
    </p>
    <div class="service-detail-grid">
      <div>
        <h3>The Visiting Room</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Ceremonies take place in the regular visiting area — there is no private chapel or ceremony room.</li>
          <li>General population inmates receive <strong>15&#8209;minute visits</strong>. The ceremony must fit within this window, so our officiant keeps it focused and meaningful.</li>
          <li>The visiting format (glass partition or contact) depends on the inmate&#39;s housing assignment and security classification.</li>
          <li>Up to <strong>3 visitors</strong> are allowed per visit at MCJ, including your required witness.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>Plan Your Day</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Total time on&#8209;site:</strong> Plan for 2–3 hours from parking to leaving, even though the ceremony itself is brief. Security screening and processing take the bulk of the time.</li>
          <li><strong>No items exchanged:</strong> Rings, gifts, documents, or any physical items cannot be passed to the inmate during the visit.</li>
          <li><strong>No photography:</strong> No cameras, phones, or recording devices are allowed inside the facility.</li>
          <li><strong>Dress code:</strong> Dress modestly. Avoid clothing that resembles inmate uniforms (solid blue). No revealing clothing, open&#8209;toed shoes, or clothing with offensive imagery.</li>
          <li><strong>Proximity to Twin Towers:</strong> Men&#39;s Central and Twin Towers share the same block on Bauchet St. If the inmate is transferred between facilities, we adjust — no need to start over.</li>
