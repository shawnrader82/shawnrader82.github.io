      Help with birth, marriage, death, and divorce certificate apostilles
    </h2>
    <p class="service-detail-lead" style="margin-bottom:18px;">
      When you apply for immigration benefits, handle an estate, register a marriage, or prove family relationships in
      another country, authorities often require a vital record with an apostille.
    </p>
    <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:10px;">
      We help clients across Los Angeles and the San Fernando Valley confirm whether their California or out‑of‑state
      birth, marriage, death, or divorce certificate is acceptable and coordinate the apostille so the paperwork is
      accepted the first time. You do not have to guess which version of your record to use, which office to contact, or
      how to submit it for authentication.
    </p>
    <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:10px;">
      Before you schedule, we review a photo of your document, your destination country, and any consulate, court, or
      lawyer instructions so you know exactly what is required and whether an apostille or another form of
      authentication is needed.

      <div>
        <div class="faq-item" style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6;">
          <h3>1. We review your vital record and instructions.</p>
          <p>
            You can text or email a photo of your birth, marriage, death, or divorce certificate along with any consulate,
            embassy, court, or attorney instructions. We confirm whether the record is eligible for apostille and which
            state or federal office will process it.
          </p>

          <h3>2. We help you obtain the right certified copy, if needed.</p>
          <p>
            If your document is too old, unofficial, or issued by the wrong office, we explain how to request the correct
            certified copy from the vital records office or court that must issue it. This helps avoid last‑minute
            rejections or requests for replacement documents.
          </p>

          <h3>3. We obtain the apostille and return your documents.</p>
          <p>
            Once the correct record is ready, we submit it for apostille and arrange secure delivery back to you or
            directly to your representative abroad, depending on your needs and the requirements of the receiving country.
          </p>
        </div>

        <p class="service-detail-lead" style="margin-top:14px; max-width:640px;">
          Processing times and fees depend on the state that issued the record, current workload, and whether you choose
          standard or expedited options where available. We outline these choices clearly before you commit so you can
          plan around your deadlines.

    </h2>

    <div class="faq-item" style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6;">
      <h3>Birth certificates</h3>
      <p>
        Birth certificates are often apostilled for immigration, dual citizenship, study abroad, and family‑based
        applications. We can help confirm whether your certificate is issued in the correct format and from the right
        office, and coordinate apostille service. For more detail about birth certificates, visit our
        <a href="/services/apostille/vital-birth.html">birth certificate apostille page</a>.
      </p>

      <h3>Marriage certificates</h3>
      <p>
        Marriage certificates are frequently apostilled for spousal visas, recognition of marriage abroad, and updating
        foreign IDs and records after marriage. We review your certificate and destination country so you know whether a
        short‑form or long‑form copy is best. For more detail, see our
        <a href="/services/apostille/vital-marriage.html">marriage certificate apostille page</a>.
      </p>

      <h3>Death certificates</h3>
      <p>
        Death certificates may be needed for estates, inheritance, pension and insurance claims, or transferring property
        in another country. We help families obtain the correct certified copy and navigate the apostille process. Learn
        more on our
        <a href="/services/apostille/vital-death.html">death certificate apostille page</a>.
      </p>

      <h3>Divorce decrees and related court orders</h3>
      <p>
        Divorce judgments, decrees, and related court orders are sometimes apostilled for remarriage abroad, name
        changes, and family law matters outside the United States. We coordinate with the issuing court and the
        appropriate apostille authority so your documents meet foreign requirements. See our
        <a href="/services/apostille/vital-divorce.html">divorce document apostille page</a> for more information.

    <h2 style="font-size:22px; margin-bottom:10px;">Questions about vital record apostilles</h2>

    <div class="faq-item" style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6;">
      <h3>Do I need a certified copy, or can I use a photocopy?</h3>
      <p>
        Most states require a recent certified copy of the vital record with the proper signatures and seals. Photocopies
        or unofficial records are usually not accepted for apostille.
      </p>

      <h3>Can you apostille records from another U.S. state?</h3>
      <p>
        Yes. Many clients in Los Angeles have vital records issued in another state. We can often help coordinate
        apostilles for those records, but they must be processed through the state that issued the document, so timing
        and fees will vary.
      </p>

      <h3>How recent does my birth, marriage, death, or divorce record need to be?</h3>
      <p>
        Some authorities accept older certified copies, while others require records issued within a certain number of
        months. We review your document and the receiving country’s guidance to let you know whether a new copy is
        recommended.
      </p>

      <h3>Will the apostilled document be returned to me?</h3>
      <p>
        In most cases, the apostille is attached directly to the original certified record or court document. We arrange
        secure return by mail, courier, or pickup and confirm the method with you before submitting your documents.
      </p>

      <h3>How do I know if I need an apostille or another type of authentication?</h3>
      <p>
        If the country where you are using your vital record is part of the Hague Apostille Convention, an apostille is
        usually required. For non‑member countries, consular legalization or another form of authentication may be
        needed, and we can help you understand the correct path before you send any originals.
