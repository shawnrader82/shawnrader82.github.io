    <div class="service-detail-kicker">Using your degree abroad</div>
    <h2 style="font-size:26px; margin-bottom:10px;">
      Make your college or university diploma valid in another country
    </h2>
    <p class="service-detail-lead" style="margin-bottom:18px;">
      Foreign universities, credential evaluators, professional licensing boards, and employers often require a
      college or university diploma with an apostille to prove your degree is genuine.
    </p>
    <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:10px;">
      An apostille is a special certificate attached by a government office that confirms the authenticity of the
      signature and seal on your diploma or on an official certification of it. Countries that are part of the Hague
      Apostille Convention accept an apostilled diploma without further consular legalization.
    </p>
    <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:10px;">
      We help you decide whether you can use your original diploma, should request a notarized copy, or need a
      registrar's certification letter so the apostille is accepted the first time and your degree documentation stays
      as safe as possible.

      <div>
        <div class="faq-block" style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6;">
          <p class="faq-question">1. We review your diploma and destination requirements.</p>
          <p class="faq-answer">
            You can text or email a clear photo or scan of your diploma and any instructions you received from a foreign
            school, licensing board, employer, or immigration office. We confirm whether your current diploma can be
            used as‑is, needs notarization, or should be supported by a registrar's certification before apostille.
          </p>

          <p class="faq-question">2. We help you obtain the right format from your school, if needed.</p>
          <p class="faq-answer">
            If your diploma cannot be notarized directly, is missing signatures, or is too valuable to risk, we explain
            how to request a notarized copy, a replacement diploma, or an official certification letter that can be
            apostilled. Our guidance is tailored to the state where your university is located and the country where the
            diploma will be used.
          </p>

          <p class="faq-question">3. We obtain the apostille and return your documents.</p>
          <p class="faq-answer">
            Once your diploma or certification is in the proper format, we submit it to the appropriate state office for
            apostille, track the request, and return the completed apostilled diploma to you by mail, courier, or local
            pickup in Los Angeles. For non‑Hague countries, we can discuss any additional authentication or consular
            steps that may be required.

        </div>

        <p class="service-detail-lead" style="margin-top:14px; max-width:640px;">
          Processing times and costs depend on the issuing state, current state office volume, and whether you choose
          standard or expedited options where available. We give you realistic timelines and fee ranges before you
          decide how to proceed.

      When Los Angeles clients apostille college and university diplomas
    </h2>

    <div class="faq-block" style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6;">
      <p class="faq-question">Graduate and professional school abroad</p>
      <p class="faq-answer">
        Many foreign master's, PhD, and professional programs require an apostilled diploma to confirm that you
        completed a recognized degree before they issue a final admission or scholarship decision.
      </p>

      <p class="faq-question">Professional licensing and board registration</p>
      <p class="faq-answer">
        Nurses, doctors, engineers, architects, teachers, and other licensed professionals are often asked for an
        apostilled diploma as part of overseas licensing, board registration, or recognition of their U.S. degree.
      </p>

      <p class="faq-question">Work visas and corporate transfers</p>
      <p class="faq-answer">
        Immigration authorities and multinational employers may require an apostilled diploma to verify that you meet
        degree requirements for a work visa, skilled‑worker program, or intra‑company transfer.
      </p>

      <p class="faq-question">Permanent residency and family immigration</p>
      <p class="faq-answer">
        Some immigration categories give extra weight to education or request degree proof for the main applicant or
        spouse. An apostilled diploma can help document your education history clearly for these applications.

    <div class="service-detail-kicker">College diploma apostille FAQ</div>
    <h2 style="font-size:22px; margin-bottom:10px;">Questions about apostilling a college or university diploma</h2>

    <div class="faq-block" style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6;">
      <p class="faq-question">Can you apostille my original diploma, or do I need a copy?</p>
      <p class="faq-answer">
        Some states allow the original diploma to be notarized by a school official or notary public, while others
        prefer a notarized copy or a registrar's certification letter attached to a copy. We review your situation and
        recommend the safest approach so you do not risk losing your only original degree.
      </p>

      <p class="faq-question">Do I also need my college transcript apostilled?</p>
      <p class="faq-answer">
        Many universities, credential evaluators, and licensing boards request both an apostilled diploma and an
        apostilled <a href="/services/apostille/school-transcript-college.html">transcript</a>. If your checklist mentions credits, grades, or detailed coursework, we often suggest
        apostilling the transcript at the same time as your diploma.
      </p>

      <p class="faq-question">My university is in another state. Can you still help?</p>
      <p class="faq-answer">
        The apostille usually must be issued by the state where the university is located or where the notarization
        took place. We confirm which state is responsible and explain how we can assist with that state's process,
        including mail‑in handling when necessary.
      </p>

      <p class="faq-question">What if I lost my diploma or it is badly damaged?</p>
      <p class="faq-answer">
        In most cases you will need to request a replacement diploma or an official degree certification from your
        university or college. We can suggest exactly what to ask the registrar for so the new document can be
        notarized and apostilled without problems.
      </p>

      <p class="faq-question">How far in advance should I start?</p>
      <p class="faq-answer">
        Depending on how quickly your school can issue the correct document and how busy the state office is, apostille
        processing can take from several business days to a few weeks. Starting early gives you more options for rush
        handling if deadlines change. For urgent cases, see our <a href="/services/apostille/same-day-los-angeles.html">same-day apostille service</a>.
