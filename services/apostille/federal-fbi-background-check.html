    <div class="service-detail-kicker">Using your FBI report abroad</div>
    <h2 style="font-size:26px; margin-bottom:10px;">
      Make your FBI background check valid in another country
    </h2>
    <p class="service-detail-lead" style="margin-bottom:18px;">
      Many foreign consulates, employers, and immigration authorities ask for an FBI Identity History Summary (FBI
      background check) with an apostille to confirm your criminal record status in the United States.
    </p>
    <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:10px;">
      An apostille is a certificate added by the U.S. Department of State that confirms the authenticity of the FBI
      official's signature and seal on your background check. Countries that are part of the Hague Apostille
      Convention accept an FBI report with apostille as an official federal document for visa and residency purposes.
    </p>
    <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:10px;">
      We help you confirm whether your FBI report is the right version (emailed PDF, printed version, or hard copy from
      a channeler), whether it needs original ink signatures, and how it must be submitted so the apostille is issued
      without delays.
    </p>

    <p style="font-size:13px; margin-top:10px;">

          <li>Review your existing FBI report or order confirmation before you mail anything, so you know whether it is

      Many clients reach out after a consulate, employer, or immigration attorney gives them a checklist that simply
      says "FBI background check with apostille." We help turn that short instruction into a specific, step‑by‑step

    <div class="service-detail-kicker">Simple 3–step process</div>
    <h2 style="font-size:22px; margin-bottom:10px;">How FBI background check apostille works</h2>

    <div class="service-detail-grid">
      <div>
        <div class="faq-item" style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6;">
          <h3>1. We review your destination requirements and FBI report status.</p>
          <p>
            You can send us a copy of your FBI background check (with any sensitive details obscured if you prefer),
            your order confirmation, or the instructions from your consulate or employer. We confirm whether you already
            have the correct type of FBI report or need to request a new one and whether the apostille must come from
            the U.S. Department of State or another authority.
          </p>

          <h3>2. We help you obtain or print the correct FBI report.</p>
          <p>
            If you still need to request the FBI background check, we explain how to submit fingerprints (via Live Scan
            or cards), whether to use the FBI or an approved channeler, and how to receive the report so it can be
            apostilled. If you already have a digital report, we confirm how it should be printed and certified for use
            in the apostille process.
          </p>

          <h3>3. We coordinate authentication and apostille and return your documents.</p>
          <p>
            Once your FBI report is in the proper format, we submit it for federal authentication and apostille, track
            processing, and return the completed apostilled report to you by mail or courier. For non‑Hague countries,
            we can discuss any additional U.S. Department of State authentication and consular steps that may be
            required after the federal stage.
          </p>
        </div>

        <p class="service-detail-lead" style="margin-top:14px; max-width:640px;">
          Processing times vary based on how quickly the FBI issues your report and current federal workloads. We outline
          realistic timelines and rush options where available so you can schedule consulate visits or travel with
          confidence.

    <h2 style="font-size:22px; margin-bottom:10px;">
      When Los Angeles clients apostille an FBI background check
    </h2>

    <div class="faq-item" style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6;">
      <h3>Long‑term visas and residency permits</h3>
      <p>
        Many countries require an apostilled FBI background check for work visas, student visas, residency permits, and
        retirement visas to confirm that applicants do not have disqualifying criminal records.
      </p>

      <h3>Teaching abroad and international employment</h3>
      <p>
        International schools, universities, and employers frequently require FBI background checks with apostille as
        part of their hiring and work‑permit process, especially for roles involving children or sensitive industries.
      </p>

      <h3>Adoption and immigration cases</h3>
      <p>
        Adoption authorities and immigration programs in some countries request an apostilled FBI background check for
        prospective parents or sponsors as part of their suitability review. For related court orders, see our
        <a href="/services/apostille/court-adoption.html">adoption apostille page</a>.
      </p>

      <h3>Volunteer and missionary work abroad</h3>
      <p>
        Humanitarian organizations and religious missions sometimes require apostilled FBI background checks to place
        volunteers in schools, hospitals, or community programs overseas.

    <div class="service-detail-kicker">FBI background check apostille FAQ</div>
    <h2 style="font-size:22px; margin-bottom:10px;">Questions about apostilling an FBI report</h2>

    <div class="faq-item" style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6;">
      <h3>Do I need the original FBI report for apostille?</h3>
      <p>
        In most cases, the U.S. Department of State requires an original FBI report with an official signature or
        certification, not just a photocopy. We review your report and let you know if it meets current federal
        requirements or if you should request a new copy before starting the apostille process.
      </p>

      <h3>Can I use a channeler-issued FBI report?</h3>
      <p>
        Many approved channelers can provide FBI background checks that are acceptable for apostille when they include
        the proper FBI seal and certification. We clarify whether your specific channeler report is eligible and how it
        should be submitted for apostille.
      </p>

      <h3>How long is my FBI background check valid?</h3>
      <p>
        The FBI does not set an expiration date, but most consulates and immigration programs only accept reports that
        are a few months old. We recommend checking your destination country's rules and planning your apostille timing
        so the report is still considered "recent" when you submit it.
      </p>

      <h3>Can I notarize my FBI background check locally instead?</h3>
      <p>
        Because an FBI report is a federal document, it typically must go through federal authentication and apostille,
        not state‑level notarization and apostille. We explain the correct federal path so you do not waste time or
        money on the wrong process.
      </p>

      <h3>What if my destination country is not part of the Hague Apostille Convention?</h3>
      <p>
        Non‑Hague countries usually require federal authentication followed by consular legalization instead of an
        apostille. We can outline the steps for your specific country so you understand whether an apostille, another
        federal certificate, or consular processing is needed.
