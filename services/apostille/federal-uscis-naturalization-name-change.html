          Help with USCIS naturalization certificates and federal name change documents
        </h2>
        <p class="service-detail-lead" style="margin-bottom:18px;">
          When you apply for dual citizenship, register a marriage, fix name mismatches, or update records abroad,
          foreign authorities often ask to see your U.S. naturalization and name change paperwork with the proper authentication or apostille.
        </p>
        <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:10px;">
          We help clients across Los Angeles confirm whether they should use a USCIS-issued certified true copy of their Certificate
          of Naturalization, a USCIS status letter, or a certified U.S. court name change order and then coordinate the state, DOJ,
          and U.S. Department of State steps so the documents are accepted overseas without repeated submissions.
        </p>
        <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:10px;">
          Before you schedule, we review scans of your documents, your destination country, and any written instructions
          from foreign consulates, registries, or attorneys so you know exactly which version of each record you need and
          whether it will follow a state or federal path.

            <div class="faq-block" style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6;">
              <p class="faq-question">1. We review your documents and destination requirements.</p>
              <p class="faq-answer">
                You can email or text clear scans of your naturalization certificate, USCIS notices or letters, and any court
                name change orders together with the instructions from the foreign authority. We confirm which documents can be used
                as‑is, which must be reissued or certified, and whether they will follow a state, DOJ, or federal U.S. Department of State path.
              </p>

              <p class="faq-question">2. We help you obtain the correct certified copies or certifications, if needed.</p>
              <p class="faq-answer">
                If your naturalization certificate is damaged, your USCIS printouts are not official, or your name change order is missing a proper
                court certification, we explain how to request a USCIS certified true copy, an updated status letter, or a certified court copy that
                will be accepted for apostille or authentication.
              </p>

              <p class="faq-question">3. We coordinate the apostille or authentication and return your documents.</p>
              <p class="faq-answer">
                Once the correct documents are ready, we coordinate the state, DOJ, and U.S. Department of State steps required for your destination
                country and arrange secure delivery back to you or directly to your attorney, consulate, or foreign registry where appropriate.

              or full consular legalization for non‑Hague countries. We outline realistic ranges and options before you decide how to proceed.

          <p class="faq-question">Do I send my naturalization certificate itself, or a certified copy?</p>
          <p class="faq-answer">
            Some countries will accept a USCIS certified true copy or status confirmation instead of the original naturalization certificate,
            while others may insist on an original document. We review the foreign instructions and help you decide which option balances safety
            and acceptance so you are not forced to replace an irreplaceable certificate later.
          </p>

          <p class="faq-question">Is my name change order handled at the state or federal level?</p>
          <p class="faq-answer">
            Most name change orders from state courts are apostilled by the Secretary of State in the state where the order was issued.
            Orders from U.S. District Courts or other federal courts usually require certification by the U.S. Department of Justice and then
            authentication or apostille by the U.S. Department of State. We help you identify which path applies to your specific order.
          </p>

          <p class="faq-question">Can I fix name mismatches without a formal court order?</p>
          <p class="faq-answer">
            In some cases, foreign authorities accept sworn statements or additional documents instead of a name change order,
            but many insist on a formal court order or clear chain of records. We can discuss what your destination typically requires
            and whether it makes sense to obtain a court order before investing in apostilles or legalizations.
          </p>

          <p class="faq-question">Do I need translations together with the apostille?</p>
          <p class="faq-answer">
            Many countries require translations of your naturalization and name change documents, sometimes by sworn or certified translators.
            We flag when translations are commonly required for your destination so you can decide whether to arrange them before or after
            the apostille or legalization steps and avoid having to repeat work.

          <p class="faq-question">How long does it take to apostille USCIS and name change documents?</p>
          <p class="faq-answer">
            Timelines vary depending on whether your case is state-only, involves DOJ and the U.S. Department of State, or requires a full consular
            legalization chain for a non‑Hague country. We review your deadline, outline current timing ranges, and suggest whether standard or
            faster courier options are realistic for your situation.
