    <div class="service-detail-kicker">Using a U.S. birth abroad certificate</div>
    <h2 style="font-size:26px; margin-bottom:10px;">
      Make your Consular Report of Birth Abroad valid in another country
    </h2>
    <p class="service-detail-lead" style="margin-bottom:18px;">
      When a child is born outside the United States to U.S. citizen parent(s), the U.S. embassy or consulate may issue
      a Consular Report of Birth Abroad (CRBA), often on Form FS‑240, to document U.S. citizenship.
    </p>
    <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:10px;">
      Foreign authorities frequently ask for the CRBA to be apostilled or authenticated before they will update local
      birth registries, issue residence permits, enroll a child in school, or process family immigration. An apostille
      confirms that the U.S. Department of State issued or certified the document and that the signature and seal are
      genuine.
    </p>
    <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:10px;">
      We help you confirm whether your current CRBA copy can be used, whether you need to request a replacement or
      additional certified copies from the U.S. Department of State, and how those records must be submitted for
      apostille or authentication for your destination country.
    </p>

        <div class="faq-item" style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6;">
          <h3>1. We review your CRBA and destination requirements.</p>
          <p>
            You can send a clear scan or photo of your child's Consular Report of Birth Abroad and any instructions from
            the foreign registry, consulate, or school. We confirm whether your current document is eligible for
            apostille or if you need to request a replacement or additional certified copies from the U.S. Department
            of State.
          </p>

          <h3>2. We help you obtain the correct certified copy if needed.</p>
          <p>
            If a new CRBA copy is required, we provide step‑by‑step instructions for requesting it, including forms,
            fees, and where to send the application. We also discuss how many originals to order in case multiple
            agencies or countries will need apostilled copies.
          </p>

          <h3>3. We coordinate federal authentication, apostille, and return delivery.</p>
          <p>
            Once your CRBA is in the proper format, we route it through the appropriate federal authentication and
            apostille or legalization process, track progress, and return the completed apostilled document to you by
            mail or courier. For non‑Hague countries, we outline any additional consular steps required after the
            federal stage.

        <p class="service-detail-lead" style="margin-top:14px; max-width:640px;">
          Because federal processing times can change, we explain current timeframes and any available rush options

    <h2 style="font-size:22px; margin-bottom:10px;">
      When families apostille a Consular Report of Birth Abroad
    </h2>

    <div class="faq-item" style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6;">
      <h3>Registering a child's birth with a foreign civil registry</h3>
      <p>
        Many countries require an apostilled CRBA before they will add a child born abroad to local birth records or
        issue a domestic birth certificate, especially in dual‑nationality situations.
      </p>

      <h3>Residence permits and family visas</h3>
      <p>
        Immigration authorities often ask for an apostilled CRBA to confirm a child's identity and relationship to U.S.
        citizen parents when issuing residence permits, long‑term visas, or family‑reunification documents.
      </p>

      <h3>Citizenship and passport applications abroad</h3>
      <p>
        Some foreign citizenship and passport offices accept a U.S. CRBA as proof of birth but still require an
        apostille or authentication to verify that the document was genuinely issued by the U.S. government.
      </p>

      <h3>School enrollment and benefits</h3>
      <p>
        Schools, health systems, and benefits agencies in other countries may request an apostilled CRBA to document a
        child's age, identity, and U.S. citizenship when registering for services or programs.

    <div class="service-detail-kicker">CRBA apostille FAQ</div>
    <h2 style="font-size:22px; margin-bottom:10px;">Questions about apostilling a Consular Report of Birth Abroad</h2>

    <div class="faq-item" style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6;">
      <h3>Can I apostille a photocopy or scan of the CRBA?</h3>
      <p>
        Foreign authorities generally require an original or certified copy issued by the U.S. Department of State, not
        just a photocopy. We help you determine whether your current CRBA is suitable or whether you should request a
        new certified copy specifically for apostille.
      </p>

      <h3>What if I lost the original Consular Report of Birth Abroad?</h3>
      <p>
        Replacement copies can usually be requested from the U.S. Department of State's vital records office. We
        provide the instructions and details you need so the replacement can be used for apostille and overseas
        registration.
      </p>

      <h3>Does a CRBA have to be notarized?</h3>
      <p>
        A Consular Report of Birth Abroad is a federal record and normally does not require notarization. Instead, it
        is authenticated and apostilled through federal channels based on the embedded signatures and seals on the
        document itself.
      </p>

      <h3>Is a CRBA the same as a birth certificate?</h3>
      <p>
        A CRBA serves a similar purpose to a U.S. birth certificate but is issued by the U.S. Department of State
        rather than a state or county. Some foreign authorities accept it on its own, while others also request local
        birth registration or additional documents. For state-issued birth certificates, see our
        <a href="/services/apostille/vital-birth.html">birth certificate apostille page</a>.
      </p>

      <h3>What if my destination country is not part of the Hague Apostille Convention?</h3>
      <p>
        Non‑Hague countries typically require federal authentication followed by consular legalization instead of an
        apostille. We can explain the steps for your specific country so you know whether you need an apostille,
        additional certificates, or consular processing.
