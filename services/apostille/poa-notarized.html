      Help with powers of attorney, affidavits, and notarized letters
    </h2>
    <p class="service-detail-lead" style="margin-bottom:18px;">
      When someone overseas needs you to sign in front of a notary—whether for a power of attorney, consent letter,
      or sworn statement—they often also require an apostille on the notarized document.
    </p>
    <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:10px;">
      We help clients across Los Angeles confirm whether their powers of attorney, affidavits, travel consents,
      invitation letters, and other notarized documents are drafted and notarized correctly for apostille and coordinate
      the process so the paperwork is accepted the first time. You do not have to guess about wording, notarization
      format, or where to send the documents afterward.
    </p>
    <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:10px;">
      Before you schedule, we review a draft or sample of your document, your destination country, and any instructions
      from the foreign lawyer, consulate, or agency so you know exactly what is required.
    </p>

    <p style="font-size:13px; margin-top:10px;">

        <div class="faq-block" style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6;">
          <p class="faq-question">1. We review your draft or notarized document and destination requirements.</p>
          <p class="faq-answer">
            You can email a draft or scanned copy of your power of attorney, affidavit, or letter along with any
            instructions from a foreign lawyer, consulate, or agency. We confirm whether the document requires
            notarization, how the notary wording should appear, and which authority will issue the apostille.
          </p>

          <p class="faq-question">2. We help you notarize the document correctly, if needed.</p>
          <p class="faq-answer">
            If your document has not yet been signed, we provide mobile notarization or explain how to meet with a local
            notary so the signature and notarial certificate comply with California law. This prevents rejections by the
            Secretary of State due to notary errors.
          </p>

          <p class="faq-question">3. We obtain the apostille and return your documents.</p>
          <p class="faq-answer">
            Once the document is signed and notarized properly, we submit it for apostille and arrange secure delivery
            back to you or directly to your contact abroad, depending on your needs.
          </p>
        </div>

        <p class="service-detail-lead" style="margin-top:14px; max-width:640px;">
          Processing times and fees depend on the issuing state, the volume of requests at the Secretary of State's
          office, and whether you choose standard or expedited options where available. We outline realistic timelines
          and costs before you commit so you can plan around transaction or travel dates.

      <p class="faq-question">Do all notarized documents qualify for an apostille?</p>
      <p class="faq-answer">
        Many personal, business, and legal documents notarized by a California notary can receive an apostille, but the
        Secretary of State may reject documents with incomplete notarial wording or documents that should have been
        issued by a government office instead of a notary.
      </p>

      <p class="faq-question">Does the power of attorney need special wording?</p>
      <p class="faq-answer">
        Foreign lawyers or consulates sometimes provide their own POA templates. We recommend following their wording
        and then ensuring the notarial certificate meets California rules so the apostille can be issued smoothly.
      </p>

      <p class="faq-question">Can you apostille a document that was notarized in another state?</p>
      <p class="faq-answer">
        Yes, but it must be apostilled in the same state where it was notarized. We can often coordinate multi‑state
        requests and explain the separate timelines and fees involved.
      </p>

      <p class="faq-question">Can a notary issue the apostille?</p>
      <p class="faq-answer">
        No. A notary performs the notarization, but the apostille itself is issued by a government authority such as the
        California Secretary of State or, for some federal documents, the U.S. Department of State.
      </p>

      <p class="faq-question">How do I know if I need an apostille or consular legalization?</p>
      <p class="faq-answer">
        Countries that are part of the Hague Apostille Convention usually require an apostille. For non‑member
        countries, additional embassy or consular legalization may be needed, and we help you understand the correct
        process before you notarize and ship your documents.
