    <div class="service-detail-kicker">Using U.S. archive records abroad</div>
    <h2 style="font-size:26px; margin-bottom:10px;">
      Make your National Archives and federal records valid in another country
    </h2>
    <p class="service-detail-lead" style="margin-bottom:18px;">
      Some U.S. federal records are stored at the National Archives or federal record centers and must be certified by
      NARA before they can be authenticated and apostilled for use overseas.
    </p>
    <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:10px;">
      These records can include historical federal court files, older immigration and naturalization records, certain
      military and service documents, and other long‑term federal archives. Foreign authorities often require certified
      copies with apostille to rely on them in citizenship, estate, or legal matters.
    </p>
    <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:10px;">
      We help you determine which NARA facility or record center holds your file, how to request certified copies that
      meet apostille standards, and how those certifications must be routed through the U.S. Department of State or
      other federal offices for apostille or authentication.
    </p>

    <p style="font-size:13px; margin-top:10px;">
      This page covers National Archives records specifically. For other federal records, visit our

        <ul>
          <li>Assist with apostilles for records held at National Archives facilities, regional archives, and federal
              record centers, including older court, immigration, and military files.</li>
          <li>Review any reference numbers, archival research results, or sample pages you already have so you know
              exactly what to request as a certified copy for apostille.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div>
        <ul>
          <li>Clarify which signatures and seals NARA or the relevant federal office must provide so the U.S.
              Department of State can authenticate and apostille the record.</li>
          <li>Set realistic expectations about NARA and federal processing times, which are often longer than standard
              state apostilles, and help you plan around foreign deadlines.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </div>

    <p style="font-size:13px; color:var(--text-muted); margin-top:14px;">
      Many clients first contact NARA or a record center on their own and then discover that foreign authorities are
      asking for "certified archival copy with apostille." We help bridge the gap between archival research and
      properly legalized documents.

    <div class="service-detail-kicker">Simple 3–step process</div>
    <h2 style="font-size:22px; margin-bottom:10px;">How NARA & federal archive apostille works</h2>

    <div class="service-detail-grid">
      <div>
        <div class="faq-block" style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6;">
          <p class="faq-question">1. We review your records and destination requirements.</p>
          <p class="faq-answer">
            You can share any NARA reference numbers, researcher emails, or sample images you already have, along with
            instructions from your foreign consulate, court, or attorney. We determine which archive or record center
            is responsible and what type of certified copy is acceptable for apostille.
          </p>

          <p class="faq-question">2. We help you request certified copies from NARA or the record center.</p>
          <p class="faq-answer">
            If no certified copies have been issued yet, we provide step‑by‑step guidance for requesting them from the
            correct NARA facility or federal office, including language to specify seals, signatures, and certifications
            that will be recognized by the U.S. Department of State.
          </p>

          <p class="faq-question">3. We coordinate federal authentication, apostille, and return delivery.</p>
          <p class="faq-answer">
            Once the archival documents are certified, we route them through the appropriate federal authentication and
            apostille or legalization process, monitor progress, and return the completed documents to you or your law
            firm by mail or courier. For non‑Hague countries, we outline any additional consular steps after federal
            authentication.

        </div>

        <p class="service-detail-lead" style="margin-top:14px; max-width:640px;">
          Archival records can involve multiple agencies and longer wait times. We explain the full path up front and
          keep you updated so you can coordinate with foreign authorities, genealogists, or attorneys.

    <h2 style="font-size:22px; margin-bottom:10px;">
      When clients apostille National Archives and federal records
    </h2>

    <div class="faq-block" style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6;">
      <p class="faq-question">Citizenship and nationality applications</p>
      <p class="faq-answer">
        People applying for citizenship or nationality abroad based on ancestry may need apostilled copies of old
        federal court, immigration, or naturalization records stored at NARA. For current USCIS certificates, see our
        <a href="/services/apostille/federal-uscis-naturalization-name-change.html">USCIS apostille page</a>.
      </p>

      <p class="faq-question">Estate, probate, and inheritance matters</p>
      <p class="faq-answer">
        Foreign courts handling estates or property sometimes require apostilled archival records, such as old federal
        court decisions or military service files, to confirm identity or status of a deceased person.
      </p>

      <p class="faq-question">Historical research with legal implications</p>
      <p class="faq-answer">
        Researchers and attorneys may need apostilled NARA documents when historical findings are used as evidence in
        foreign legal disputes or restitution claims.
      </p>

      <p class="faq-question">Military and service documentation abroad</p>
      <p class="faq-answer">
        In some countries, veterans' benefits, pensions, or honorary recognitions require apostilled copies of U.S.
        federal military records obtained through archives or record centers.

    <div class="service-detail-kicker">NARA & federal archive apostille FAQ</div>
    <h2 style="font-size:22px; margin-bottom:10px;">Questions about apostilling National Archives documents</h2>

    <div class="faq-block" style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6;">
      <p class="faq-question">Can I apostille photocopies of archival documents I already have?</p>
      <p class="faq-answer">
        Photocopies or research prints are usually not enough. For apostille, foreign authorities typically require
        certified copies issued by NARA or the relevant federal office, bearing official seals and signatures. We help
        you request the correct certified version.
      </p>

      <p class="faq-question">Do all federal records go through NARA?</p>
      <p class="faq-answer">
        Not always. Some recent records are still held by the original agency or a federal record center. We review
        your situation and explain whether NARA, a record center, or the issuing agency is responsible for certifying
        your documents before apostille.
      </p>

      <p class="faq-question">How long do National Archives requests take?</p>
      <p class="faq-answer">
        Timeframes vary depending on the type of record and how far it must be retrieved. It can range from a few weeks
        to several months. We factor these timelines into your overall apostille plan and recommend starting as early
        as possible.
      </p>

      <p class="faq-question">Can I notarize archival records locally instead of using NARA certification?</p>
      <p class="faq-answer">
        Local notarization of copies usually will not satisfy foreign or federal requirements for archival records.
        The safer route is to obtain certified copies directly from NARA or the responsible federal office and then
        proceed through the proper federal authentication and apostille process.
      </p>

      <p class="faq-question">What if my destination country is not part of the Hague Apostille Convention?</p>
      <p class="faq-answer">
        Non‑Hague countries often require federal authentication followed by consular legalization rather than an
        apostille. We can outline the steps for your specific country so you know whether you need an apostille,
        additional certificates, or consular processing.
