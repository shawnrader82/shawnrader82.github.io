    <h2 style="font-size:26px; margin-bottom:10px;">
      Make your high school transcript valid in another country
    </h2>
    <p class="service-detail-lead" style="margin-bottom:18px;">
      Foreign schools, universities, employers, and immigration authorities often require an official high school
      transcript with an apostille to verify your grades, coursework, and graduation status.
    </p>
    <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:10px;">
      An apostille is a special certificate issued by a government office that confirms the authenticity of the
      signature and seal on your transcript or on an official school certification. Countries that are part of the
      Hague Apostille Convention accept an apostilled transcript without further consular legalization.
    </p>
    <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:10px;">
      We help you understand whether you can use a standard official transcript, need a notarized school statement,
      or should request a special certification letter so the apostille is accepted the first time.
    </p>

        <div class="faq-item" style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6;">
          <h3>1. We review your transcript and destination requirements.</p>
          <p>
            You can text or email a copy of your transcript (or a sample), along with any instructions from the foreign
            school, university, or immigration office. We confirm whether the document is an official school‑issued
            transcript and whether it must be notarized, sealed, or reissued before it can be apostilled.
          </p>

          <h3>2. We help you obtain the right version from the school, if needed.</p>
          <p>
            If your transcript is a student copy, was printed from a portal, or arrived unsealed, we explain exactly how
            to request the correct official version—such as a school‑issued transcript in a sealed envelope, a
            notarized registrar statement, or a certification letter that can receive an apostille. We tailor guidance
            to the state where the school is located and the country where the transcript will be used.
          </p>

          <h3>3. We obtain the apostille and return your documents.</p>
          <p>
            Once your transcript or certification is in the proper format, we submit it to the appropriate state office
            for apostille, track the request, and return the completed apostilled transcript to you by mail, courier, or
            local pickup in Los Angeles. For non‑Hague countries, we can discuss any additional authentication or
            consular steps that may be required.

        </div>

        <p class="service-detail-lead" style="margin-top:14px; max-width:640px;">
          Processing times and costs depend on the issuing state, current state office volume, and whether you choose
          standard or expedited options where available. We provide realistic timelines and fee ranges before you decide
          how to proceed.

    </h2>

    <div class="faq-item" style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6;">
      <h3>Study abroad and exchange programs</h3>
      <p>
        Overseas high schools, language institutes, and exchange programs often require an apostilled transcript to
        verify your academic standing, grades, and credits before they will finalize enrollment or placement.
      </p>

      <h3>Foreign university admissions</h3>
      <p>
        Many international universities require apostilled high school transcripts as part of undergraduate admissions
        to verify that you meet their academic requirements and completed required coursework.
      </p>

      <h3>Family immigration and school placement abroad</h3>
      <p>
        Families relocating overseas are frequently asked for children's transcripts to help foreign schools determine
        grade placement and verify prior education. Apostilled transcripts speed up the enrollment process.
      </p>

      <h3>Work visas and credential verification</h3>
      <p>
        Some immigration authorities and employers request apostilled high school transcripts, especially when the
        job or visa category requires proof of secondary education completion or specific coursework.

    <div class="service-detail-kicker">High school transcript apostille FAQ</div>
    <h2 style="font-size:22px; margin-bottom:10px;">Questions about apostilling a high school transcript</h2>

    <div class="faq-item" style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6;">
      <h3>Does my transcript need to be in a sealed envelope?</h3>
      <p>
        Many foreign schools and immigration offices require transcripts to remain in a sealed school envelope,
        and some state offices will only apostille transcripts that are still sealed. We confirm the exact requirement
        for your situation so you do not accidentally open documents that must stay sealed.
      </p>

      <h3>Can you apostille a transcript I printed from the school portal?</h3>
      <p>
        Portal printouts and unofficial copies usually cannot be apostilled directly. In most cases, you will need to
        request an official transcript from the school office, which can then be notarized if required and apostilled.
        We will explain what your school's options are.
      </p>

      <h3>My high school is in another state. Can you still help?</h3>
      <p>
        The apostille must usually be issued by the state where the high school is located or where the notarization
        takes place. We confirm which state is responsible and outline how we can assist with that state's process,
        including mail‑in handling when needed.
      </p>

      <h3>Do I also need my diploma apostilled?</h3>
      <p>
        Some checklists ask for both an apostilled <a href="/services/apostille/school-diploma-high-school.html">diploma</a> and an apostilled transcript. If requirements mention proof
        of graduation plus detailed grades or coursework, we often recommend apostilling both documents together so you
        do not face last‑minute requests later.
      </p>

      <h3>How far in advance should I start?</h3>
      <p>
        Depending on how quickly your school can issue the correct transcript and how busy the state office is,
        apostille processing can range from several business days to a few weeks. Starting early gives you more options
        for rush or expedited service if deadlines change. For urgent cases, see our
        <a href="/services/apostille/same-day-los-angeles.html">same-day apostille service</a>.
