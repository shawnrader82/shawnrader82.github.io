      Help with apostilles for corporate resolutions, incumbency certificates, and corporate powers of attorney
    </h2>
    <p class="service-detail-lead" style="margin-bottom:18px;">
      Foreign banks, counterparties, and registries often ask for corporate resolutions, certificates of incumbency,
      or corporate powers of attorney with an apostille attached to confirm who is authorized to sign on behalf of the company,
      especially when the company is formed or operating in California.
    </p>
    <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:10px;">
      We help companies across Los Angeles prepare, notarize, and apostille authority documents so that signers, officers,
      and appointed agents are recognized without questions by overseas institutions. This includes board or member
      resolutions, officer and director lists, and company‑granted powers of attorney.
    </p>
    <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:10px;">
      Before you schedule, we review drafts or samples of your documents, your destination country, and any instructions
      from foreign banks, registries, or attorneys so you know exactly what is required and whether additional company
      records such as <a href="/services/apostille/business-articles-incorporation.html">articles of incorporation</a>
      or <a href="/services/apostille/business-good-standing.html">good standing certificates</a> should be included.
    </p>

    <p style="font-size:13px; margin-top:10px;">
      If you also need formation or status documents, visit our
      <a href="/services/apostille/business-corporate.html">business &amp; corporate apostille page</a> for an overview

          <h3>1. We review your corporate authority documents and requirements.</p>
          <p>
            You can email or upload draft or executed corporate resolutions, certificates of incumbency, officer lists,
            or corporate powers of attorney along with any instructions from a foreign bank, registry, or attorney.
            We verify that the documents are suitable for notarization and apostille and confirm which state will issue
            the apostille.
          </p>

          <h3>2. We help you execute and notarize the documents correctly.</p>
          <p>
            Many authority documents must be signed in front of a notary with specific wording or capacity statements.
            We walk you through who needs to sign, how to identify their titles, and any witness or notarization
            requirements so your resolutions, incumbency certificates, or corporate POAs are ready for apostille.
          </p>

          <h3>3. We obtain the apostille and return your documents.</p>
          <p>
            Once the documents are properly signed and notarized, we submit them for apostille in the appropriate state
            and arrange secure delivery back to your office or directly to your bank, registry, or counterpart abroad,
            depending on your needs and schedule.
          </p>
        </div>

        <p class="service-detail-lead" style="margin-top:14px; max-width:640px;">
          Processing times and fees depend on the state where the documents are notarized, the volume of documents, and
          whether you choose standard or expedited apostille options where available. We outline realistic timelines and
          costs before you commit.

      Typical resolutions, incumbency certificates, and corporate powers used overseas
    </h2>

    <div class="faq-item" style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6;">
      <h3>Board and member resolutions</p>
      <p>
        Resolutions authorizing specific officers, directors, or managers to sign contracts, open bank or investment
        accounts, or complete transactions often need to be notarized and apostilled so foreign institutions can rely
        on them.
      </p>

      <h3>Certificates of incumbency and officer lists</p>
      <p>
        Certificates that list current officers, directors, or managers and confirm their positions may be requested
        with an apostille so overseas banks and counterparties can verify who is currently in charge of the company.
      </p>

      <h3>Corporate powers of attorney</p>
      <p>
        When a company grants a power of attorney to an individual or firm to act on its behalf in another country,
        that corporate POA usually must be properly notarized and apostilled so local authorities and counterparties
        will honor it.
      </p>

      <h3>Other corporate authority documents</p>
      <p>
        Depending on the transaction, you may also be asked for officer or director appointment minutes, specimen
        signature lists, or other notarized statements about company authority to satisfy foreign compliance or
        regulatory requirements.

    <h2 style="font-size:22px; margin-bottom:10px;">Questions about apostilling corporate resolutions and powers</h2>

    <div class="faq-item" style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6;">
      <h3>Do corporate resolutions and powers of attorney need notarization?</p>
      <p>
        In most cases, yes. Corporate resolutions, certificates of incumbency, and corporate powers of attorney must
        be signed in front of a notary before an apostille can be issued. We guide you on the proper notary wording
        and signing process.
      </p>

      <h3>Who needs to sign corporate authority documents?</p>
      <p>
        Typically, an authorized officer, director, or manager signs on behalf of the company, and in some cases
        multiple signatures or witness signatures may be required. We review your drafts and help you identify who
        should sign and how their titles should be listed.
      </p>

      <h3>Which state issues the apostille for corporate authority documents?</p>
      <p>
        Corporate resolutions, incumbency certificates, and corporate powers of attorney are generally apostilled in
        the state where they were notarized, regardless of where the company is formed or where the document will be
        used. We confirm the correct state authority for your situation.
      </p>

      <h3>Can you help with corporate POAs for non‑Hague Convention countries?</p>
      <p>
        For countries that are not part of the Hague Apostille Convention, your corporate POA or authority documents
        may require additional consular or embassy legalization after state authentication. We can help you understand
        the correct path based on your destination.
      </p>

      <h3>What if the bank or registry also asks for articles or good standing?</p>
      <p>
        Many institutions request a package that includes authority documents plus
        <a href="/services/apostille/business-articles-incorporation.html">articles of incorporation</a>
        and a <a href="/services/apostille/business-good-standing.html">certificate of good standing or status</a>.
        We can help you plan for those additional records so everything can be notarized, apostilled, and submitted together.
