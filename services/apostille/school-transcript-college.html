    <h2 style="font-size:26px; margin-bottom:10px;">
      Make your college or university transcript valid in another country
    </h2>
    <p class="service-detail-lead" style="margin-bottom:18px;">
      Foreign universities, credential evaluation agencies, professional licensing boards, and immigration authorities
      often require an official college or university transcript with an apostille.
    </p>
    <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:10px;">
      An apostille is a special certificate issued by a government office that confirms the authenticity of the
      signature and seal on your transcript or on an official registrar's certification. Countries that are part of the
      Hague Apostille Convention accept an apostilled transcript without further consular legalization.
    </p>
    <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:10px;">
      We help you understand whether you can use a standard official transcript, need a notarized registrar statement,
      or should request a special certification letter so the apostille is accepted the first time.
    </p>

        <div class="faq-item" style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6;">
          <h3>1. We review your transcript and destination requirements.</p>
          <p>
            You can text or email a copy of your transcript (or a sample), along with any instructions from the foreign
            university, credential evaluator, licensing board, or immigration office. We confirm whether the document is
            an official registrar‑issued transcript and whether it must be notarized, sealed, or reissued before it can
            be apostilled.
          </p>

          <h3>2. We help you obtain the right version from the registrar, if needed.</p>
          <p>
            If your transcript is a student copy, was printed from a portal, or arrived unsealed, we explain exactly how
            to request the correct official version—such as a registrar‑issued transcript in a sealed envelope, a
            notarized registrar statement, or a certification letter that can receive an apostille. We tailor guidance
            to the state where the school is located and the country where the transcript will be used.
          </p>

          <h3>3. We obtain the apostille and return your documents.</p>
          <p>
            Once your transcript or certification is in the proper format, we submit it to the appropriate state office
            for apostille, track the request, and return the completed apostilled transcript to you by mail, courier, or
            local pickup in Los Angeles. For non‑Hague countries, we can discuss any additional authentication or
            consular steps that may be required.

        </div>

        <p class="service-detail-lead" style="margin-top:14px; max-width:640px;">
          Processing times and costs depend on the issuing state, current state office volume, and whether you choose
          standard or expedited options where available. We provide realistic timelines and fee ranges before you decide
          how to proceed.

      When Los Angeles clients apostille college and university transcripts
    </h2>

    <div class="faq-item" style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6;">
      <h3>Graduate and professional school applications</h3>
      <p>
        Many foreign master's, PhD, and professional programs require an apostilled transcript to verify your prior
        degree, coursework, and credits before issuing a final admission or scholarship.
      </p>

      <h3>Foreign credential evaluation</h3>
      <p>
        Credential evaluation agencies often request sealed, official transcripts with an apostille so they can compare
        your degree to local standards for employment, licensing, or further study.
      </p>

      <h3>Professional licensing and exams abroad</h3>
      <p>
        Nurses, engineers, accountants, teachers, and other professionals may need apostilled transcripts to qualify
        for overseas licensing exams, registration, or recognition of their U.S. degree.
      </p>

      <h3>Work visas and corporate transfers</h3>
      <p>
        Some immigration authorities and multinational employers require an apostilled transcript, not just a
        <a href="/services/apostille/school-diploma-college.html">diploma</a>, to verify degree level, major, and date of completion for work visa processing.

    <div class="service-detail-kicker">College transcript apostille FAQ</div>
    <h2 style="font-size:22px; margin-bottom:10px;">Questions about apostilling a college or university transcript</h2>

    <div class="faq-item" style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6;">
      <h3>Does my transcript need to be in a sealed envelope?</h3>
      <p>
        Many foreign schools and credential evaluators require transcripts to remain in a sealed registrar envelope,
        and some state offices will only apostille transcripts that are still sealed. We confirm the exact requirement
        for your situation so you do not accidentally open documents that must stay sealed.
      </p>

      <h3>Can you apostille electronic or PDF transcripts?</h3>
      <p>
        Electronic transcripts sent directly to you or to a third party are useful for review, but apostilles usually
        require paper records. In some cases, the registrar can print and certify an electronic transcript so it
        becomes acceptable for apostille. We will explain what your school's options are.
      </p>

      <h3>My university is in another state. Can you still help?</h3>
      <p>
        The apostille must usually be issued by the state where the university is located or where the notarization
        takes place. We confirm which state is responsible and outline how we can assist with that state's process,
        including mail‑in handling when needed.
      </p>

      <h3>Do I also need my diploma apostilled?</h3>
      <p>
        Some checklists ask for both an apostilled <a href="/services/apostille/school-diploma-college.html">diploma</a> and an apostilled transcript. If requirements mention proof
        of graduation plus detailed coursework, we often recommend apostilling both documents together so you do not
        face last‑minute requests later.
      </p>

      <h3>How far in advance should I start?</h3>
      <p>
        Depending on how quickly your registrar can issue the correct transcript and how busy the state office is,
        apostille processing can range from several business days to a few weeks. Starting early gives you more options
        for rush or expedited service if deadlines change. For urgent cases, see our
        <a href="/services/apostille/same-day-los-angeles.html">same-day apostille service</a>.
