    </h2>
    <p class="service-detail-lead" style="margin-bottom:18px;">
      When a foreign bank, company registry, or business partner needs proof that your U.S. company is legally formed and in good standing, they typically require one or more corporate documents with an apostille attached.
    </p>
    <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:10px;">
      We help Los Angeles businesses identify exactly which documents are needed for their destination country, confirm that each document is in the correct format for apostille, and coordinate the full process—from obtaining certified copies to submitting for apostille and returning the completed documents.
    </p>
    <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:10px;">
      Before you schedule, we review scans of your documents, your destination country requirements, and any instructions from foreign banks, registries, or attorneys so you know exactly what is required.

          <h3>1. We review your documents and destination requirements.</h3>
          <p>
            Email or upload copies of your business documents along with any instructions from a foreign bank, registry, or attorney. We verify that each document is in an acceptable format and determine which authority will issue the apostille.

        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>2. We help you obtain certified copies or notarization if needed.</h3>
          <p>
            If your documents are uncertified printouts, missing notarization, or outdated, we explain how to get the correct versions before moving ahead. For corporate resolutions and similar internal documents, we can notarize them on-site and submit directly for apostille.

        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>3. We obtain the apostille and return your documents.</h3>

            Once all documents are ready, we submit them for apostille and arrange secure delivery back to your office or directly to your bank, registry, or counterpart abroad.

        </div>

        <p class="service-detail-lead" style="margin-top:14px; max-width:640px;">
          Processing times and fees depend on whether your company is formed in California or another state, how many documents are involved, and whether you choose standard or expedited apostille options. We outline realistic timelines and costs before you commit.

    <h2 style="font-size:22px; margin-bottom:10px;">Questions about business and corporate document apostilles</h2>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3>What business documents can be apostilled?</h3>
      <p>
        Common business documents include articles of incorporation or organization, certificates of good standing (also called certificates of status or existence), corporate resolutions, bylaws, operating agreements, and other formation or governance records. The document must be either state-issued or properly notarized before an apostille can be attached.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3>Do I need a certified copy or can I use the original?</h3>
      <p>
        For state-issued documents like articles of incorporation, you typically need a certified copy from the Secretary of State. For internal documents like corporate resolutions, the document must be notarized. We review your specific documents and confirm what format is required before proceeding.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3>Can you apostille business documents from states other than California?</h3>
      <p>
        Yes. Each document must be apostilled by the Secretary of State in the state where the business is formed or where the notarization took place. We coordinate the process regardless of which state issued your documents.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3>Do foreign banks require specific documents alongside the apostille?</h3>
      <p>
        Many foreign banks ask for a combination of documents—typically <a href="/services/apostille/business-articles-incorporation.html">articles of incorporation</a> plus a <a href="/services/apostille/business-good-standing.html">certificate of good standing</a>, and sometimes a <a href="/services/apostille/business-resolutions.html">corporate resolution</a> authorizing the account opening. We help you identify the full list before starting so nothing is missing.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3>How long does the business document apostille process take?</h3>
      <p>
        Timing depends on whether certified copies need to be obtained from the Secretary of State and whether you choose standard or expedited processing. California state apostilles typically take 3 to 10 business days by mail, with same-day rush available for qualifying documents. We provide a realistic timeline after reviewing your documents.
