    <div class="service-detail-kicker">Why This Matters Right Now</div>
    <h2>Protect Your Family with the Right Documents</h2>
    <p class="service-detail-lead">
      Thousands of California families are apostilling critical documents right now &mdash; whether for an upcoming visa application, a planned move abroad, or as a protective measure in case of family separation.
    </p>
    <div class="service-detail-grid">
      <div>
        <p>An apostille makes your U.S. document legally recognized in any country that is part of the Hague Apostille Convention. Without it, foreign governments, courts, and schools may reject your paperwork entirely &mdash; even if the document itself is perfectly valid.</p>
        <p>For immigration-related documents, the stakes are higher and the timelines are tighter. A rejected or delayed apostille can hold up a visa, a custody arrangement, or a property transfer at the worst possible time.</p>
        <p>We review every document before submission to make sure the signatures, seals, and formatting meet the requirements of both the issuing state and the destination country. If something needs to be corrected, we catch it before it causes a delay.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <div class="urgency-banner">
          <strong>Mixed-status families:</strong> Many households are proactively apostilling powers of attorney, custody agreements, and vital records as a protective legal step.

          <h3>How long does it take?</h3>
          <p>California state apostilles take 3 to 10 business days by mail, with same-day rush available. Federal apostilles through the U.S. Department of State take 4 to 8 weeks. Consular legalization timelines vary by embassy.</p>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>How much does it cost?</h3>
          <p>The California Secretary of State charges $20 per document. Our service fee covers document review, preparation, submission, and return shipping. Total cost depends on the number of documents, whether notarization is needed, and the type of processing. Call or text <a href="tel:12139332507">(213) 933&#8209;2507</a> for an exact quote.</p>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>Can you handle documents from other states?</h3>
          <p>Yes. Each document must be apostilled by the Secretary of State in the state where it was issued or notarized. We coordinate that process regardless of the state.</p>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>Do I also need a translation?</h3>
          <p>Many countries require a certified or sworn translation alongside the apostille. Some countries require a specific type of sworn translator. We can connect you with qualified translators or coordinate translation as part of your order.</p>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>What if my document gets rejected?</h3>
          <p>Rejections usually happen because of incorrect notarization, missing seals, outdated records, or submitting to the wrong office. We review every document before submission specifically to prevent this. If something needs to be corrected, we catch it early and help you fix it.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>Can I mail my documents to you?</h3>
          <p>Yes. Many of our clients are outside the LA area or prefer to mail documents. We walk you through secure shipping options and confirm everything by phone, text, or email before you send anything.</p>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>I&#39;m preparing for possible family separation. Can you help?</h3>
          <p>Yes. Many families in mixed-status households are proactively apostilling custody agreements, powers of attorney, and vital records. We handle these cases with urgency and discretion. You don&#39;t need to explain your circumstances &mdash; just tell us what you need and where it&#39;s going.</p>
