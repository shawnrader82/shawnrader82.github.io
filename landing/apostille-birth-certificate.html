    <div class="service-detail-kicker">Why Birth Certificates</div>
    <h2>The Most Common Document We Apostille</h2>
    <p class="service-detail-lead">
      Birth certificates are the single most frequently apostilled document we handle. They are required for almost every international process that involves proving identity, citizenship, or family relationships.
    </p>

    <div class="service-detail-grid">
      <div>
        <h3>Common reasons clients need this</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Dual citizenship applications</strong> — proving U.S. birth to claim citizenship in a parent's or grandparent's country of origin.</li>
          <li><strong>Immigration petitions</strong> — sponsoring family members or establishing identity for visa and residency applications.</li>
          <li><strong>Marriage abroad</strong> — many countries require an apostilled birth certificate before issuing a marriage license to a foreigner.</li>
          <li><strong>School enrollment overseas</strong> — registering children in foreign schools often requires an apostilled birth record.</li>
          <li><strong>Foreign property and inheritance</strong> — proving family relationships for estate claims, property transfers, and pension benefits abroad.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>What gets people stuck</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Using a <strong>hospital souvenir certificate</strong> instead of an official certified copy — the Secretary of State will reject it immediately.</li>
          <li>Submitting a <strong>photocopy or home-printed scan</strong> instead of an original certified copy with a raised or stamped seal.</li>
          <li>Not realizing the birth certificate must be apostilled by the <strong>state that issued it</strong>, not the state where you currently live.</li>
          <li>Ordering a certified copy but getting one with a <strong>faint or missing registrar signature</strong> — this can trigger rejection.</li>
          <li>Waiting until the last minute and discovering the Secretary of State is <strong>backed up for weeks</strong> during peak season.</li>
        </ul>

    <div class="service-detail-kicker">The Process</div>
    <h2>How We Apostille Your Birth Certificate</h2>
    <p class="service-detail-lead" style="color:#d1d5db;">
      Every case starts with us confirming your document is in the right format before anything is submitted. Here is the typical path.
    </p>

    <div class="service-detail-grid">
      <div>
        <h3 style="color:#f9fafb;">Step-by-step</h3>
        <ul style="color:#d1d5db;">
          <li><strong style="color:#f9fafb;">1. You contact us</strong> — tell us which state issued the birth certificate, which country it's going to, and your deadline. We confirm the exact route.</li>
          <li><strong style="color:#f9fafb;">2. We review your document</strong> — you send us a photo or scan. We check that it's a certified copy with proper seal, signature, and format. If it won't pass, we tell you before you waste time or money.</li>
          <li><strong style="color:#f9fafb;">3. We submit for apostille</strong> — we file with the correct Secretary of State (California or other state). Same-day and rush options available for California.</li>
          <li><strong style="color:#f9fafb;">4. Consular legalization (if needed)</strong> — for non-Hague countries, we continue through the U.S. Department of State and the destination embassy or consulate.</li>
          <li><strong style="color:#f9fafb;">5. Return to you</strong> — completed documents returned by hand, courier, or mail, ready for use abroad. Translation coordinated alongside if needed.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3 style="color:#f9fafb;">What makes us different</h3>
        <ul style="color:#d1d5db;">
          <li>We <strong style="color:#f9fafb;">review before we submit</strong> — most rejections happen because the document wasn't checked first. We catch problems early.</li>
          <li>We handle <strong style="color:#f9fafb;">any state, not just California</strong> — if your birth certificate was issued in Texas, New York, or any other state, we coordinate with that state's Secretary of State.</li>
          <li><strong style="color:#f9fafb;">Same-day rush</strong> available for California birth certificates when your deadline is tight.</li>
          <li>We tell you upfront if you need to <strong style="color:#f9fafb;">order a fresh certified copy</strong> — saving you from a rejection after you've already paid and waited.</li>
          <li>We coordinate <strong style="color:#f9fafb;">translation services</strong> so your apostille and translation arrive together, ready for the foreign office.</li>
        </ul>

    <h2>What Will and Won't Be Accepted</h2>
    <p class="service-detail-lead">
      The Secretary of State will only apostille a birth certificate that meets specific format requirements. Here's what works and what doesn't.
    </p>

    <div class="service-detail-grid">
      <div>
        <h3>✅ Will be accepted</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Certified copy from the <strong>state vital records office</strong> or <strong>county recorder</strong> with registrar seal and signature.</li>
          <li>Recently issued certified copies — especially helpful if the foreign office requires a record less than 6 or 12 months old.</li>
          <li>Certified copies with a <strong>clear, legible seal</strong> — raised, stamped, or embossed.</li>
          <li>Multiple certified copies if you need apostilles for more than one country or purpose (each apostille attaches to one document).</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>❌ Will be rejected</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Hospital souvenir certificates</strong> — decorative certificates with baby footprints, given at the hospital. These are not official records.</li>
          <li><strong>Photocopies or scanned printouts</strong> — even if the original was legitimate, a photocopy is not a certified copy.</li>
          <li>Certificates with <strong>missing or illegible seals</strong> — faded ink stamps or absent embossed seals.</li>
          <li>Certificates <strong>issued by a different state</strong> submitted to the wrong Secretary of State — each state only apostilles its own documents.</li>
          <li><strong>"Informational" copies</strong> marked "not valid for legal purposes" — some states issue these by default if you don't specifically request a certified copy.</li>

    <h2>Birth Certificate Apostille Timelines</h2>
    <p class="service-detail-lead">
      Actual processing times depend on which state issued your birth certificate and whether you need additional steps like consular legalization.
    </p>

    <div class="service-detail-grid">
      <div>
        <h3>California birth certificates</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Same-day or next business day</strong> — available with in-person filing at the California Secretary of State when your case qualifies for rush processing.</li>
          <li><strong>1–3 business days</strong> — standard in-person filing turnaround during normal volume periods.</li>
          <li><strong>1–2 weeks by mail</strong> — if in-person filing is not used, mail processing times vary based on volume and holidays.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>Other states</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>3–10 business days</strong> — most states process apostilles within this window by mail, with some offering expedited options.</li>
          <li><strong>Walk-in / in-person</strong> — some states allow same-day or next-day service if we appear in person or use an authorized agent.</li>
          <li><strong>Add time for consular legalization</strong> — non-Hague countries require U.S. Department of State authentication and embassy legalization, which can add several weeks.</li>
