    <div class="service-detail-kicker">Using school letters abroad</div>
    <h2 style="font-size:26px; margin-bottom:10px;">
      Make your enrollment or graduation letter valid in another country
    </h2>
    <p class="service-detail-lead" style="margin-bottom:18px;">
      Foreign schools, consulates, and immigration offices often ask for an official letter from your school confirming
      enrollment, attendance, or graduation before they will finalize a visa, placement, or application.
    </p>
    <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:10px;">
      An apostille is a special certificate attached by a government office that confirms the authenticity of the
      signature and seal on your school's letter or on a notarial certification of it. Countries that are part of the
      Hague Apostille Convention accept an apostilled letter without further consular legalization.
    </p>
    <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:10px;">
      These letters usually must be printed on official school letterhead, signed by an authorized official, and dated
      within a recent time frame—often the last 30–90 days. We help you confirm exactly what the foreign school or
      consulate expects so you do not waste time chasing the wrong paperwork.

      Many clients come to us after receiving checklists that mention "official enrollment letter with apostille" or
      "graduation letter with apostille" without any detail on who should sign, how recent it must be, or whether
      notarization is required. We translate those requirements into simple, step‑by‑step instructions you can give
      your school.

    <h2 style="font-size:22px; margin-bottom:10px;">How school enrollment & graduation letter apostille works</h2>

    <div class="service-detail-grid">
      <div>
        <div class="faq-item" style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6;">
          <h3>1. We review your letter requirements and destination.</p>
          <p>
            You can text or email a clear photo or draft of your school letter along with any instructions from the
            foreign school, consulate, or immigration office. We confirm whether the letter has the right wording,
            letterhead, signatures, and dates, and we identify any changes needed before apostille is possible.
          </p>

          <h3>2. We help you request the correct letter format from the school.</p>
          <p>
            If you still need to request the letter, we outline exactly what to ask the registrar or school office for:
            who should sign, what details to include (enrollment dates, graduation date, program, full legal name), and
            whether the letter must be notarized on campus or attached to a separate notary certificate. We tailor this
            guidance to the state where the school is located and the country where the letter will be used.
          </p>

          <h3>3. We obtain the apostille and return your documents.</p>
          <p>
            Once your letter is in the proper format and notarized if required, we submit it to the appropriate state
            office for apostille, track the request, and return the completed apostilled letter to you by mail, courier,
            or local pickup in Los Angeles. For non‑Hague countries, we can discuss any additional authentication or
            consular steps beyond the apostille.
          </p>
        </div>

        <p class="service-detail-lead" style="margin-top:14px; max-width:640px;">
          Processing times and costs depend on the issuing state, the type of school, and whether you choose standard or
          expedited options where available. We give you realistic timelines and fee ranges up front so you can plan
          around visa appointments, school start dates, or employer deadlines.

    <div class="service-detail-kicker">Common reasons for a school letter apostille</div>
    <h2 style="font-size:22px; margin-bottom:10px;">
      When Los Angeles clients apostille enrollment and graduation letters
    </h2>

    <div class="faq-item" style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6;">
      <h3>Student visas and study‑abroad programs</h3>
      <p>
        Consulates and foreign schools often require a recent enrollment letter with an apostille to confirm that you
        are currently registered full‑time or will be returning after your program. We help ensure the letter meets
        their specific wording and date requirements.
      </p>

      <h3>School transfers for children and teens</h3>
      <p>
        Families moving overseas are frequently asked for enrollment or attendance letters from their child's current
        school to assist with grade placement and registration abroad. Apostilled letters help foreign schools trust
        the information without additional verification.
      </p>

      <h3>Graduation letters when a diploma is not ready yet</h3>
      <p>
        Some universities and high schools issue graduation confirmation letters weeks or months before
        <a href="/services/apostille/school-diploma-college.html">diplomas</a> are printed. These letters can often be apostilled so you can move forward with job offers, visa applications, or
        further study while you wait for the physical diploma.
      </p>

      <h3>"Good standing" and conduct letters</h3>
      <p>
        Certain exchange programs, internships, and scholarships ask for a letter confirming that a student is in good
        standing, has no major disciplinary issues, or is eligible to continue studies. We help schools format and
        notarize these letters so they can receive an apostille.
      </p>

      <h3>Program completion and certificate letters</h3>
      <p>
        Professional courses, language programs, and training centers sometimes issue completion letters rather than
        formal diplomas. When those letters must be recognized overseas, an apostille on the signed letter can provide
        the necessary proof.

    <div class="service-detail-kicker">Enrollment & graduation letter apostille FAQ</div>
    <h2 style="font-size:22px; margin-bottom:10px;">Questions about apostilling school letters</h2>

    <div class="faq-item" style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6;">
      <h3>Can I use a PDF or portal printout, or do I need an original letter?</h3>
      <p>
        In most cases, the state office will require an original letter on school letterhead with a wet‑ink signature
        from an authorized official, sometimes notarized, before it can receive an apostille. We will tell you whether
        a printed PDF is acceptable or if a fresh original must be issued.
      </p>

      <h3>Who should sign the letter so it can be apostilled?</h3>
      <p>
        Requirements vary by state and school. Some states accept signatures from principals, counselors, or academic
        deans, while others want a registrar or designated official. We review your situation and advise which signer
        is most likely to be accepted for apostille.
      </p>

      <h3>Does the letter need to be notarized?</h3>
      <p>
        Many school letters must either be notarized by a school‑affiliated notary or attached to a notary certificate
        confirming the signer's identity and authority. We explain the options available through your school and what
        the apostille‑issuing state will accept.
      </p>

      <h3>How recent does my enrollment or graduation letter need to be?</h3>
      <p>
        Consulates and schools often require letters issued within the last 30–90 days, and some will reject older
        letters as out of date. When you share your foreign instructions, we help you time the letter and apostille so
        it will still be considered current at your appointment.
      </p>

      <h3>My school is in another state. Can you still help?</h3>
      <p>
        The apostille usually must be issued by the state where the school is located or where the notarization occurs.
        We confirm which state is responsible and outline how we can assist with that state's process, including
        mail‑in options, while you remain in Los Angeles.
      </p>

      <h3>Do I also need my transcript or diploma apostilled?</h3>
      <p>
        Some checklists ask for an enrollment or graduation letter plus an apostilled
        <a href="/services/apostille/school-transcript-college.html">transcript</a> or
        <a href="/services/apostille/school-diploma-college.html">diploma</a>. If your destination requires additional records, we can coordinate everything so your letters, transcripts, and
        diplomas are prepared together instead of in separate rushed steps. For urgent cases, see our
