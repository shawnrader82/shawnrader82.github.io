      Help with apostilles for certificates of good standing and status
    </h2>
    <p class="service-detail-lead" style="margin-bottom:18px;">
      Foreign banks, registries, and partners often ask for a Certificate of Good Standing (also called a Certificate of
      Status or Existence) with an apostille attached to confirm your company is active and in compliance, especially
      when it is formed or operating in California.
    </p>
    <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:10px;">
      We help companies across Los Angeles confirm whether their good standing certificate is in the right format and
      date range, obtain a current certificate from the appropriate state agency when needed, and coordinate the apostille
      so the paperwork is accepted the first time overseas.
    </p>
    <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:10px;">
      Before you schedule, we review a scan or sample of your certificate, your destination country, and any written
      requirements from foreign banks, registries, or attorneys so you know exactly what is required and whether other
      documents such as
      <a href="/services/apostille/business-articles-incorporation.html">articles of incorporation</a>
      should be included in your package.
    </p>

    <p style="font-size:13px; margin-top:10px;">
      If you also need formation documents or resolutions, visit our
      <a href="/services/apostille/business-corporate.html">business &amp; corporate apostille page</a> for an overview
      of all company document types we handle.

          <p class="faq-question">1. We review your certificate and destination requirements.</p>
          <p class="faq-answer">
            You can email or upload a copy of your Certificate of Good Standing or Status, along with any instructions
            from a foreign bank, registry, or attorney. We verify that it is an official state certificate and confirm
            which authority will issue the apostille.
          </p>

          <p class="faq-question">2. We help you obtain a current certificate, if needed.</p>
          <p class="faq-answer">
            If your certificate is too old, not an official state document, or missing required details, we explain how
            to request a current Certificate of Good Standing or Status from the California Secretary of State or the
            state where your company is formed before moving ahead.
          </p>

          <p class="faq-question">3. We obtain the apostille and return your documents.</p>
          <p class="faq-answer">
            Once the correct certificate is ready, we submit it for apostille and arrange secure delivery back to your
            office or directly to your bank, registry, or counterpart abroad, depending on your needs and timing.

        <p class="service-detail-lead" style="margin-top:14px; max-width:640px;">
          Processing times and fees depend on the issuing state, how quickly a current certificate can be obtained, and
          whether you choose standard or expedited apostille options where available. We outline realistic timelines and
          costs before you commit.

      Typical situations and document requirements for good standing certificates
    </h2>

    <div class="faq-block" style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6;">
      <p class="faq-question">Opening or maintaining foreign bank accounts</p>
      <p class="faq-answer">
        Banks often request an apostilled Certificate of Good Standing or Status to confirm the company is active,
        compliant, and authorized to hold accounts before completing onboarding or periodic reviews.
      </p>

      <p class="faq-question">Registering or renewing entities abroad</p>
      <p class="faq-answer">
        Foreign registries frequently require a recent good standing certificate, sometimes together with
        <a href="/services/apostille/business-articles-incorporation.html">articles of incorporation</a>
        and translated copies, when you register a branch, subsidiary, or renew an existing registration.
      </p>

      <p class="faq-question">Recency and official format requirements</p>
      <p class="faq-answer">
        Many banks and government agencies require that good standing certificates be issued within the last 30–90 days
        and be official state documents, not internal or third‑party summaries. We help you confirm the required date
        range and format for your specific destination.
      </p>

      <p class="faq-question">Companies formed outside California</p>
      <p class="faq-answer">
        If your company was formed in another U.S. state, the Certificate of Good Standing must come from that state's
        filing office, and the apostille will also be issued there. We can still review your situation and explain what
        to request from the appropriate state authority.

    <h2 style="font-size:22px; margin-bottom:10px;">Questions about apostilling certificates of good standing</h2>

    <div class="faq-block" style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6;">
      <p class="faq-question">Does my certificate need to be an original state document?</p>
      <p class="faq-answer">
        Yes, apostilles for good standing are generally issued on original Certificates of Good Standing, Certificates
        of Status, or similar documents issued directly by the state, not on ordinary photocopies or unofficial letters.
        We help you determine whether your certificate qualifies.
      </p>

      <p class="faq-question">How recent should the certificate be?</p>
      <p class="faq-answer">
        Many banks and registries insist that good standing certificates be issued within a recent time frame, often
        30–90 days. We review any written requirements from your foreign counterpart and advise if you should order a
        new certificate before requesting an apostille.
      </p>

      <p class="faq-question">Can you apostille a good standing certificate from another state?</p>
      <p class="faq-answer">
        Each state apostilles documents that it issues. If your corporation or LLC is formed outside California, the
        good standing certificate must be apostilled in the state where it was issued, but we can explain the steps and
        what to ask for from that state.
      </p>

      <p class="faq-question">Do good standing certificates need notarization first?</p>
      <p class="faq-answer">
        State‑issued Certificates of Good Standing are usually submitted directly for apostille without additional
        notarization. Only separate, privately prepared statements about a company's status would need notarization
        first before they could be apostilled.
      </p>

      <p class="faq-question">How do we know if we need an apostille or consular legalization?</p>
      <p class="faq-answer">
        Countries that are part of the Hague Apostille Convention generally accept an apostille on your good standing
        certificate, while non‑member countries may require consular or embassy legalization after state authentication.
        We help you understand the correct path for your destination.
