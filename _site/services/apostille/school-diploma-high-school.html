      Make your high school diploma valid in another country
    </h2>
    <p class="service-detail-lead" style="margin-bottom:18px;">
      Many foreign schools, employers, and immigration authorities require a high school diploma with an apostille
      to prove your education level.
    </p>
    <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:10px;">
      An apostille is a special certificate attached by a government office that confirms the authenticity of the
      signature and seal on your diploma or on an official school certification of it. Countries that are part of
      the Hague Apostille Convention accept an apostilled diploma without further consular legalization.
    </p>
    <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:10px;">
      We help you figure out whether you can use your original diploma, need a notarized copy, or should request a new
      certified diploma or letter from your school so the apostille is accepted the first time.
    </p>

        <div class="faq-block" style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6;">
          <p class="faq-question">1. We review your diploma and destination requirements.</p>
          <p class="faq-answer">
            You can text or email a clear photo or scan of your diploma and any instructions you received from a foreign
            school, employer, or immigration office. We confirm whether your current diploma can be used as‑is, needs
            notarization, or should be replaced with a new certified or notarized version from your high school or
            district office.
          </p>

          <p class="faq-question">2. We help you obtain the right version from your school, if needed.</p>
          <p class="faq-answer">
            If your diploma is missing signatures, cannot be notarized directly, or is too valuable to risk, we explain
            how to request a notarized copy, a replacement diploma, or a registrar's certification letter that can be
            apostilled. We tailor the instructions to the state where the school is located and the country where the
            diploma will be used.
          </p>

          <p class="faq-question">3. We obtain the apostille and return your documents.</p>
          <p class="faq-answer">
            Once your diploma or certification is in the proper format, we submit it to the correct state office for
            apostille, track the request, and return the completed apostilled diploma to you by mail, courier, or local
            pickup in Los Angeles. For non‑Hague countries, we can discuss the additional authentication or consular
            steps that may be required.

        </div>

        <p class="service-detail-lead" style="margin-top:14px; max-width:640px;">
          Processing times and costs depend on the issuing state, current state office volume, and whether you choose
          standard or expedited options where available. We give you realistic timelines and fee ranges before you
          decide how to proceed.

    <div class="faq-block" style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6;">
      <p class="faq-question">Can you apostille my original diploma, or do I need a copy?</p>
      <p class="faq-answer">
        Many states allow the original diploma if it is properly notarized by a school official or notary public, while
        others prefer a notarized copy or a registrar's certification letter attached to a copy. We review your
        situation and recommend the safest approach so you do not risk losing your only original diploma.
      </p>

      <p class="faq-question">Do I also need my high school transcript apostilled?</p>
      <p class="faq-answer">
        Some foreign schools and immigration offices want both an apostilled diploma and an apostilled
        <a href="/services/apostille/school-transcript-high-school.html">transcript</a>. If your checklist mentions grades or coursework, we will likely recommend apostilling the transcript as well and
        can handle both documents together.
      </p>

      <p class="faq-question">My high school is in another state. Can you still help?</p>
      <p class="faq-answer">
        The apostille usually must be issued by the state where the school is located or where the notarization took
        place. We will confirm which state is responsible and explain how we can assist with that state's process,
        including mail‑in options.
      </p>

      <p class="faq-question">What if I lost my diploma?</p>
      <p class="faq-answer">
        In most cases you will need to request a replacement diploma or official certification from your high school or
        district office. We can suggest what to ask for so the new document can be notarized and apostilled without
        problems.
      </p>

      <p class="faq-question">How far in advance should I start?</p>
      <p class="faq-answer">
        Depending on the state office and whether your diploma is already in the correct format, apostille processing
        can take from several business days to a few weeks. It is best to start as soon as you receive document
        requirements from the foreign school, employer, or consulate. For urgent cases, see our
