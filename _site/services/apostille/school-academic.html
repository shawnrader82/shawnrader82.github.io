      Help with transcripts, diplomas, and enrollment letters
    </h2>
    <p class="service-detail-lead" style="margin-bottom:18px;">
      When you apply to a foreign school, professional program, employer, or immigration authority, they often require
      U.S. academic records with an apostille.
    </p>
    <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:10px;">
      We help students, graduates, and professionals across Los Angeles confirm whether their transcripts, diplomas,
      enrollment or graduation letters, and other school records are in the right format for apostille and coordinate
      the process so the paperwork is accepted the first time. You do not have to guess which version to order from the
      school or whether it must be notarized.
    </p>
    <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:10px;">
      Before you schedule, we review a sample or photo of your document, the issuing school or university, your
      destination country, and any instructions from the foreign institution so you know exactly what is required.
    </p>

    <p style="font-size:13px; margin-top:10px;">
      This page covers academic documents broadly. For specific record types, see our detailed pages for

        <div class="faq-block" style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6;">
          <p class="faq-question">1. We review your school document and destination requirements.</p>
          <p class="faq-answer">
            You can text or email a copy of your transcript, diploma, or school letter along with any instructions from
            the foreign school, employer, or agency. We confirm whether the record is eligible for apostille and what
            the issuing school or registrar must do before it can be processed.
          </p>

          <p class="faq-question">2. We help you obtain the right version from the school, if needed.</p>
          <p class="faq-answer">
            If your document is a student copy, missing signatures, or not properly notarized or certified, we explain
            how to request the correct version—such as a registrar‑issued transcript, notarized diploma copy, or
            official enrollment letter—so you do not waste time and fees on the wrong paperwork.
          </p>

          <p class="faq-question">3. We obtain the apostille and return your documents.</p>
          <p class="faq-answer">
            Once the correct school documents are ready, we submit them for apostille and arrange secure delivery back
            to you or directly to the foreign school, credential evaluator, or employer when appropriate.
          </p>
        </div>

        <p class="service-detail-lead" style="margin-top:14px; max-width:640px;">
          Processing times and fees depend on the issuing state, the type of school, and whether you choose standard or
          expedited options where available. We outline realistic timelines and costs before you commit so you can
          plan around application or visa deadlines.

    <div class="faq-block" style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6;">
      <p class="faq-question">Official transcripts</p>
      <p class="faq-answer">
        Many foreign schools and credential evaluators require official transcripts issued by the registrar and sometimes
        notarized by a school official before apostille. We help you confirm the correct issuing office and whether your
        transcripts must be in sealed envelopes or can be processed as loose pages. See our pages for
        <a href="/services/apostille/school-transcript-high-school.html">high school transcripts</a> and
        <a href="/services/apostille/school-transcript-college.html">college transcripts</a>.
      </p>

      <p class="faq-question">Diplomas and degree certificates</p>
      <p class="faq-answer">
        Some countries ask for a notarized copy of your diploma or degree certificate with an apostille to verify
        completion of a program. We explain whether your original can be used or if a notarized copy or replacement
        diploma is recommended for apostille. See our pages for
        <a href="/services/apostille/school-diploma-high-school.html">high school diplomas</a> and
        <a href="/services/apostille/school-diploma-college.html">college diplomas</a>.
      </p>

      <p class="faq-question">Enrollment, attendance, and graduation letters</p>
      <p class="faq-answer">
        Enrollment verification, letters of attendance, and graduation confirmation letters may need to be signed by an
        authorized school official and notarized before they can be apostilled. We coordinate the notarization and
        apostille steps so the letters meet foreign requirements.
      </p>

      <p class="faq-question">Professional and licensing program records</p>
      <p class="faq-answer">
        Records from professional schools and licensing programs—such as nursing or technical programs—may need
        apostilles for overseas employment or licensing. We review the instructions from foreign regulators and help
        you prepare the correct combination of transcripts, certificates, and letters.

    <div class="service-detail-kicker">School & academic apostille FAQ</div>
    <h2 style="font-size:22px; margin-bottom:10px;">Questions about apostilling school documents</h2>

    <div class="faq-block" style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6;">
      <p class="faq-question">Do transcripts need to be sealed or notarized?</p>
      <p class="faq-answer">
        Some destinations accept registrar‑issued transcripts without notarization, while others require a notarized
        statement from a school official or sealed envelopes. We review the foreign institution's instructions and tell
        you which version to request.
      </p>

      <p class="faq-question">Can you apostille school records from another state?</p>
      <p class="faq-answer">
        Yes. Many clients studied in another U.S. state but now live in Los Angeles. We can often help coordinate
        apostilles for those records, but they must be processed through the state where the school issued or notarized
        the documents, so timing and fees will vary.
      </p>

      <p class="faq-question">Can I use scanned or electronic transcripts?</p>
      <p class="faq-answer">
        Electronic transcripts sent by email are useful for review, but apostilles usually require paper records that
        meet specific certification or notarization rules. We will tell you whether your electronic copy can be converted
        into an acceptable format or if you must request new paper records.
      </p>

      <p class="faq-question">Will my original diploma be returned?</p>
      <p class="faq-answer">
        If your original diploma is used for apostille, the apostille is typically attached directly to it and the
        document is returned after processing. When possible, we may recommend using a notarized copy instead to keep
        your original diploma safe.
      </p>

      <p class="faq-question">How do I know if I need an apostille or another type of authentication?</p>
      <p class="faq-answer">
        If the country where you plan to study or work is part of the Hague Apostille Convention, an apostille is
        usually required. For non‑member countries, consular legalization or another form of authentication may be
        needed, and we can help you understand the correct path before you send any originals.
