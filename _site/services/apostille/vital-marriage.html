      Make your marriage certificate valid in another country
    </h2>
    <p class="service-detail-lead" style="margin-bottom:18px;">
      When you apply for immigration benefits, spousal visas, name changes, or family‑based matters in another country,
      authorities often require a marriage certificate with an apostille.
    </p>
    <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:10px;">
      We help couples across Los Angeles and the San Fernando Valley confirm whether their California or out‑of‑state
      marriage certificate is acceptable and coordinate the apostille so the paperwork is accepted the first time.
      You do not have to guess which version of the certificate to use or how to submit it.
    </p>
    <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:10px;">
      Before you schedule, we review a photo of the marriage certificate, your destination country, and any consulate or
      lawyer instructions so you know exactly what is required.
    </p>

    <div class="service-detail-grid">
      <div>
        <div class="faq-item" style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6;">
          <h3>1. We review your marriage certificate and instructions.</p>
          <p>
            You can text or email a photo of your marriage certificate along with any consulate, embassy, or attorney
            instructions. We confirm whether the certificate is eligible for apostille and which office will process it.
          </p>

          <h3>2. We help you obtain the right certificate, if needed.</p>
          <p>
            If your certificate is too old, unofficial, or issued by the wrong office, we explain how to request a proper
            certified copy before moving ahead. This helps avoid last‑minute rejections.
          </p>

          <h3>3. We obtain the apostille and return your documents.</p>
          <p>
            Once the correct certificate is ready, we submit it for apostille and arrange secure delivery back to you or
            directly to your representative abroad, depending on your needs.
          </p>
        </div>

        <p class="service-detail-lead" style="margin-top:14px; max-width:640px;">
          Processing times and fees depend on the state that issued the certificate, current workload, and whether you
          choose standard or expedited options where available. We outline these choices clearly before you commit.

    <div class="service-detail-kicker">Why people apostille marriage certificates</div>
    <h2 style="font-size:22px; margin-bottom:10px;">
      Common reasons Los Angeles clients need a marriage certificate apostille
    </h2>

    <div class="faq-item" style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6;">
      <h3>Immigration and residency</h3>
      <p>
        Spousal and family‑based immigration applications often require a marriage certificate with an apostille to prove
        the relationship is legally recognized.
      </p>

      <h3>Name changes and identification</h3>
      <p>
        Updating foreign passports, IDs, and records after marriage may require a certified marriage certificate with an
        apostille so authorities can verify the change.
      </p>

      <h3>Recognition of marriage abroad</h3>
      <p>
        Some countries ask for an apostilled marriage certificate to register your marriage with their civil registry, even
        if the ceremony took place in the United States.
      </p>

      <h3>Family law and inheritance matters</h3>
      <p>
        <a href="/services/apostille/vital-divorce.html">Divorce</a>, separation, adoption, and inheritance proceedings handled in another country may require an apostilled
        marriage certificate as part of the court file.
      </p>

    <div class="service-detail-kicker">Marriage certificate apostille FAQ</div>
    <h2 style="font-size:22px; margin-bottom:10px;">Questions about marriage certificate apostilles</h2>

    <div class="faq-item" style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6;">
      <h3>Do I need a long‑form or short‑form marriage certificate?</h3>
      <p>
        Some countries accept short‑form certificates, but many consulates and immigration offices prefer or require a
        long‑form certificate that shows more details. We can review your current copy and advise which version is best
        for your situation.
      </p>

      <h3>Can you apostille a marriage certificate from another U.S. state?</h3>
      <p>
        Yes. We can often help coordinate apostilles for marriage certificates issued in other states, but they must be
        processed through that state's apostille authority. Timing and fees will vary by state.
      </p>

      <h3>What if our marriage certificate is missing or damaged?</h3>
      <p>
        If your original certificate is missing or damaged, we can explain how to request a new certified copy from the
        correct vital records office before moving forward with the apostille.
      </p>

      <h3>Will the apostilled marriage certificate be returned to us?</h3>
      <p>
        Yes. The apostille is generally attached directly to the original marriage certificate. We arrange secure return
        by mail, courier, or pickup and review options with you before we submit the documents.
      </p>

      <h3>How do I know if I need an apostille or another type of authentication?</h3>
      <p>
        If the country using your marriage certificate is part of the Hague Apostille Convention, an apostille is usually
        required. For non‑member countries, consular legalization or another authentication may be needed. For urgent cases,
        see our <a href="/services/apostille/same-day-los-angeles.html">same-day apostille service</a>.
