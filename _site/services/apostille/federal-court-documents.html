    <div class="service-detail-kicker">Using federal court records abroad</div>
    <h2 style="font-size:26px; margin-bottom:10px;">
      Make your U.S. federal court documents valid in another country
    </h2>
    <p class="service-detail-lead" style="margin-bottom:18px;">
      Foreign courts, government agencies, and lawyers often require certified copies of U.S. federal court judgments,
      orders, and case records with apostille or authentication before they will rely on them.
    </p>
    <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:10px;">
      Because these documents come from U.S. District Courts or Courts of Appeals, they usually need a special form of
      federal certification before they can be apostilled or legalized. The goal is to create a chain of signatures
      that foreign authorities can trust.
    </p>
    <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:10px;">
      We help you request the right type of certified copy from the federal court clerk, confirm which federal
      authority must authenticate it, and then coordinate apostille or authentication for your destination country.
    </p>

    <p style="font-size:13px; margin-top:10px;">

    <div class="service-detail-grid">
      <div>
        <div class="faq-block" style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6;">
          <p class="faq-question">1. We review your case and the foreign requirements.</p>
          <p class="faq-answer">
            You can send copies of your federal court documents, the case caption, and any instructions from foreign
            counsel or the court. We identify which documents need certified copies, whether they must bear a clerk's
            seal, and which federal authentication path applies for your destination country.
          </p>

          <p class="faq-question">2. We help you obtain properly certified federal court records.</p>
          <p class="faq-answer">
            If new certified copies are needed, we provide clear instructions for requesting them from the appropriate
            U.S. District Court or Court of Appeals clerk, including what to ask for and how many originals to order.
            We then verify that the signatures and seals on the records meet the standards required for federal
            authentication and apostille.
          </p>

          <p class="faq-question">3. We coordinate authentication, apostille, and return delivery.</p>
          <p class="faq-answer">
            Once your records are in the correct format, we submit them for the required federal authentication and
            apostille or legalization, track processing, and return the completed documents to you or your law firm by
            mail or courier. For non‑Hague countries, we can outline additional consular legalization steps after the
            federal stage.
          </p>
        </div>

        <p class="service-detail-lead" style="margin-top:14px; max-width:640px;">
          Federal court documents often involve multiple government offices and longer timelines than state records. We
          set expectations up front and discuss any available rush options so you can coordinate with foreign counsel
          and courts.

      <p class="faq-question">Foreign litigation and enforcement of judgments</p>
      <p class="faq-answer">
        Parties seeking to recognize or enforce a U.S. federal judgment in another country are often asked to submit
        certified copies of the judgment and related orders with apostille or authentication.
      </p>

      <p class="faq-question">Cross‑border business and bankruptcy matters</p>
      <p class="faq-answer">
        Businesses involved in cross‑border insolvency, reorganization, or other federal proceedings may need
        apostilled copies of bankruptcy orders, confirmations, or other case records for foreign courts and regulators.
      </p>

      <p class="faq-question">Immigration and nationality cases</p>
      <p class="faq-answer">
        Certain immigration or nationality matters abroad may require proof of U.S. federal court decisions, especially
        where status, name changes, or specific findings were issued by a federal judge. For USCIS documents, see our

      <p class="faq-question">Can I use the copies I downloaded from PACER?</p>
      <p class="faq-answer">
        PACER printouts are not usually sufficient for apostille or authentication. Most foreign authorities require
        certified copies bearing the federal court clerk's seal and signature. We explain exactly what to order from
        the clerk's office.
      </p>

      <p class="faq-question">Do federal court documents go through state or federal apostille?</p>
      <p class="faq-answer">
        Because these documents originate from federal courts, they typically require a federal‑level authentication
        and apostille process, not just a state apostille. We confirm the correct path for your specific records and
        destination country.
      </p>

      <p class="faq-question">Can I notarize federal court documents locally instead?</p>
      <p class="faq-answer">
        Having a local notary copy‑certify a federal court record usually will not meet foreign or federal requirements.
        The safer approach is to obtain official certified copies from the court and proceed through the appropriate
        federal authentication channel.
      </p>

      <p class="faq-question">How many certified copies should I order?</p>
      <p class="faq-answer">
        Some clients need the same record for multiple foreign jurisdictions or agencies. We can help you decide how
        many apostilled originals to plan for so you do not have to re‑start the process later.
      </p>

      <p class="faq-question">How long does federal court apostille take?</p>
      <p class="faq-answer">
        Timing depends on how quickly the court issues certified copies and current processing times at the federal
        authentication and apostille offices. We provide a realistic range and discuss rush options when available so
        you can coordinate with foreign deadlines.
