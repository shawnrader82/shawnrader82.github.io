    <h2 style="font-size:26px; margin-bottom:10px;">
      Make a Consular Report of Death Abroad valid in another country
    </h2>
    <p class="service-detail-lead" style="margin-bottom:18px;">
      When a U.S. citizen passes away outside the United States, a U.S. embassy or consulate may issue a Consular Report
      of Death Abroad or a similar consular death certificate summarizing local records and U.S. citizenship details.
    </p>
    <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:10px;">
      Foreign courts, insurance companies, pension providers, and government agencies often require this consular death
      record to be apostilled or authenticated before they will process estates, close accounts, or release benefits.
      The apostille confirms that the document was genuinely issued or certified by the U.S. government and that the
      signature and seal are valid.
    </p>
    <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:10px;">
      We help you confirm whether your existing consular death report can be used, whether certified copies or
      replacements must be requested from the U.S. Department of State, and how those documents must be submitted for
      apostille or authentication for your destination country.
    </p>

    <h2 style="font-size:22px; margin-bottom:10px;">How Consular Report of Death Abroad apostille works</h2>

    <div class="service-detail-grid">
      <div>
        <div class="faq-block" style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6;">
          <p class="faq-question">1. We review your consular death record and destination requirements.</p>
          <p class="faq-answer">
            You can send a clear scan or photo of the Consular Report of Death Abroad or U.S. consular death
            certificate, along with any instructions from foreign courts, banks, or attorneys. We confirm whether your
            current document is eligible for apostille and whether additional certified copies should be requested.
          </p>

          <p class="faq-question">2. We help you obtain the correct certified copies, if needed.</p>
          <p class="faq-answer">
            If you need replacements or more originals, we provide step‑by‑step instructions for requesting them from
            the U.S. Department of State or other appropriate office, including information to include and how many
            certified copies to order for your estate, insurance, or legal needs.
          </p>

          <p class="faq-question">3. We coordinate federal authentication, apostille, and return delivery.</p>
          <p class="faq-answer">
            Once your consular death record is in the proper format, we route it through the appropriate federal
            authentication and apostille or legalization process, track progress, and return the completed documents to
            you or your attorney by mail or courier. For non‑Hague countries, we explain any additional consular
            legalization steps after the federal stage.
          </p>
        </div>

        <p class="service-detail-lead" style="margin-top:14px; max-width:640px;">
          Federal processing can take longer than state apostilles. We outline current timeframes and discuss options
          early on so you can coordinate with court hearings, claim deadlines, and other time‑sensitive tasks.

      <p class="faq-question">Probate and estate administration in another country</p>
      <p class="faq-answer">
        Foreign courts and notaries handling estates often require an apostilled consular death record before they will
        open a file, appoint an executor, or allow property to be sold or transferred.
      </p>

      <p class="faq-question">Life insurance and pension claims</p>
      <p class="faq-answer">
        Insurance companies and pension providers may ask for an apostilled Consular Report of Death Abroad to verify
        death details and U.S. citizenship when processing claims and survivor benefits.

      <p class="faq-question">Bank accounts and investments abroad</p>
      <p class="faq-answer">

    <h2 style="font-size:22px; margin-bottom:10px;">Questions about apostilling a Consular Report of Death Abroad</h2>

    <div class="faq-block" style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6;">
      <p class="faq-question">Can I apostille a photocopy of the consular death record?</p>
      <p class="faq-answer">
        Photocopies are rarely accepted. Most foreign authorities require an original or certified copy issued by the
        U.S. Department of State or consulate. We help you determine whether your document is suitable or if a new
        certified copy should be ordered.
      </p>

      <p class="faq-question">What if we never received a Consular Report of Death Abroad?</p>
      <p class="faq-answer">
        In many cases, families can request a copy or official record of the consular death report from the U.S.
        Department of State. We provide guidance on how to submit that request and what information to include.
      </p>

      <p class="faq-question">Does the consular death record need to be notarized?</p>
      <p class="faq-answer">
        Consular death records are federal documents and typically do not require notarization. Instead, they are
        authenticated and apostilled through federal channels based on the embedded signatures and seals on the
        certificate itself.
      </p>

      <p class="faq-question">Is this different from a local foreign death certificate?</p>
      <p class="faq-answer">
        Yes. A Consular Report of Death Abroad summarizes information from local civil records and U.S. citizenship
        documentation. Some foreign authorities only need the consular record; others may request both the local death
        certificate and the consular report, sometimes each with an apostille.
      </p>

      <p class="faq-question">What if the country where we are using the document is not part of the Hague Apostille Convention?</p>
      <p class="faq-answer">
        For non‑Hague countries, consular death records usually go through federal authentication followed by consular
        legalization rather than a straight apostille. We can outline the steps for your specific country so you know
        which certificates and stamps will be required.
