          <p class="service-detail-lead">
            Real estate transactions run on strict timelines. Loan rate locks, escrow deadlines, and
            recording cutoffs mean your documents must be signed and notarized correctly the first time.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Even a single missed signature can delay closing or recording.</li>
            <li>Deeds and deeds of trust usually must be notarized before the county will record them.</li>
            <li>Certain real property documents require a thumbprint in the notary journal under California law.</li>
          </ul>

        <div>
          <h3>Who we help</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Home buyers and sellers who need a notary at home, work, or a neutral location.</li>
            <li>Investors and landlords handling multiple properties or 1031 exchanges.</li>
            <li>Escrow officers and realtors who need a reliable mobile notary partner.</li>
            <li>Families handling inter-family transfers, adding or removing someone from title, or trust funding.</li>

          <p style="font-size:13px; color:var(--text-muted); margin-top:10px;">
            We coordinate with your escrow, lender, or attorney so your signing is fast, accurate, and

          <div class="faq-block" style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6;">
            <p class="faq-question">1. Share your signing details</p>
            <p class="faq-answer">
              Call, text, or have your escrow officer reach out with the property address, type of
              transaction (purchase, sale, refinance, transfer), and your preferred signing date and time.
            </p>

            <p class="faq-question">2. Confirm documents and ID</p>
            <p class="faq-answer">
              We confirm which documents require notarization, how many signers there are, and what ID
              each signer will use. For real property documents, we also confirm thumbprint requirements
              in the notary journal.
            </p>

            <p class="faq-question">3. Choose the signing location</p>
            <p class="faq-answer">
              We can meet at your home, workplace, escrow office, a coffee shop, or another convenient
              location in Los Angeles County. Everyone who needs to sign must be present with valid ID.

            <p class="faq-question">4. Review and sign documents</p>
            <p class="faq-answer">
              You or your escrow / lender prepare the documents. We verify identity, witness signatures,
              complete the notarial certificates, and obtain any required thumbprints in our journal for
              documents affecting real property.
            </p>

            <p class="faq-question">5. Return to escrow or your chosen recipient</p>
            <p class="faq-answer">
              Once the signing is complete, we can return documents directly to your escrow company,
              attorney, or lender, or leave them with you with clear instructions on where to deliver
              or ship them.

            Real estate signings range from a simple deed notarization to a full loan package. Pricing
            depends on the number of notarized signatures, travel distance, and how long the appointment

          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Single-property deeds and transfers:</strong> Typically a standard mobile notary visit with travel plus per-signature fees.</li>
            <li><strong>Loan signings / refinance packages:</strong> Flat or time-based pricing depending on package size and distance.</li>
            <li>Additional signers, multiple properties, or off-hour appointments may have adjusted fees.</li>

      <h2>Real Estate Notary FAQs</h2>

      <div class="faq-block">
        <p class="faq-question">Can you explain my loan documents?</p>
        <p class="faq-answer">
          We are not attorneys or loan officers and cannot give legal or financial advice. We can point
          out where to sign and notarize your signature, but any questions about terms, rates, or legal
          effect should be answered by your lender, escrow officer, or attorney.
        </p>

        <p class="faq-question">Do I need witnesses for my real estate documents?</p>
        <p class="faq-answer">
          Most California real estate documents do not require witnesses beyond the notary. Some out‑of‑state
          or lender-specific documents may request witnesses; let us know ahead of time if your documents
          mention witnesses so we can plan accordingly.
        </p>

        <p class="faq-question">Can you notarize for out-of-state properties?</p>
        <p class="faq-answer">
          Yes. As long as the notarization itself follows California notary law and is performed in
          California, the documents can relate to property in another state. Your escrow or attorney
          can confirm any state-specific formatting they require.
        </p>

        <p class="faq-question">Can you handle last-minute signings?</p>
        <p class="faq-answer">
          Often, yes. Real estate timelines can change quickly. Call or text with your deadline, and we
          will let you know the soonest available time for a signing.
        </p>

        <p class="faq-question">Do you work directly with escrow companies?</p>
        <p class="faq-answer">
          Yes. We frequently coordinate directly with escrow officers, who send the documents to us or
          to you ahead of time. This helps make the signing smoother and ensures everything needed is
          ready at the appointment.
