    <h2>General Mobile Notary FAQ</h2>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3>How much does a mobile notary cost in Los Angeles?</h3>
      <p>
        General mobile notary appointments typically start at $75–$125 depending on the number of
        signatures, time of day, and travel distance. Same-day, after-hours, and weekend appointments
        may include an additional fee. Contact us at
        <a href="tel:12139332507">(213) 933-2507</a> for an exact quote.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3>Can a mobile notary come to my house?</h3>
      <p>
        Yes. We travel to homes, apartments, offices, coffee shops, hospitals, care facilities, and
        other locations across Los Angeles, Orange, and Ventura counties. You choose the location
        that works best for you.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3>Can you create my document on-site?</h3>
      <p>
        Yes. We bring a laptop, portable printer, and scanner to every appointment. You can use our
        Rocket Lawyer account or any legal document source of your choosing to create, review, and
        print your document on the spot — then sign and notarize it in the same visit. Laptop and
        printer rental is available as an add-on service.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3>Do I need an appointment or can I get same-day service?</h3>
      <p>
        Same-day and next-day appointments are frequently available. Book online through our
        <a href="https://book.squareup.com/appointments/mp3gi6wm4xznjs/location/7NFJ60G7B23YS/services/A4Y3VY5DP6THP4ZKQI565KCC">

        check availability.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3>What ID do I need for notarization in California?</h3>
      <p>
        California law requires a valid, current government-issued photo ID. Accepted forms include a
        California driver license, state ID card, U.S. passport, or foreign passport. Expired IDs are
        not accepted.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3>What is the difference between an acknowledgment and a jurat?</h3>
      <p>
        An <strong>acknowledgment</strong> confirms the signer is willingly signing the document and
        acknowledges the signature is theirs. A <strong>jurat</strong> requires the signer to sign in
        front of the notary and swear or affirm under oath that the contents of the document are true.
        The document itself or the requesting party usually specifies which notarial act is needed.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3>What documents can a notary NOT notarize?</h3>
      <p>
        In California, notaries cannot notarize vital records such as birth, death, or marriage
        certificates issued by a government agency. Notaries also cannot notarize documents where the
        signer is not present, cannot be properly identified, or appears to be under duress or
        mentally incapacitated.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3>Can a notary help me fill out my document?</h3>
      <p>
        A notary cannot provide legal advice or tell you what to write. However, we bring a laptop
        with document creation tools so you can draft or customize your own document from templates
        on platforms like Rocket Lawyer — then print, sign, and notarize in the same visit.
