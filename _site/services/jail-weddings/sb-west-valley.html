      <div>
        <h3>The Visiting Room</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Ceremonies take place in the regular visiting area &mdash; there is no private chapel or ceremony room.</li>
          <li>Visit lengths depend on the inmate&#39;s housing unit and classification. Our officiant keeps the ceremony focused and meaningful within whatever window is available.</li>
          <li>The visiting format (glass partition or contact visit) depends on the inmate&#39;s security classification.</li>

          <li><strong>No photography:</strong> No cameras, phones, or recording devices are allowed inside the facility.</li>
