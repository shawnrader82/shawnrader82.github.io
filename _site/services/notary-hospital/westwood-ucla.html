      Bedside notary visits at UCLA in Westwood
    </h2>
    <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:12px;">
      Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center is a 520-bed, 10-story academic medical center located at 757 Westwood Plaza on the UCLA campus in West Los Angeles. A beacon of medical excellence since 1955, the hospital spans 4 acres and is the <strong>flagship hospital of UCLA Health</strong> &#8212; ranked <strong>#1 in California and the West Coast</strong> (tied with Cedars-Sinai) by <em>U.S. News &amp; World Report</em> for over 36 consecutive years. All patient rooms are private, equipped with panoramic views of gardens and green spaces, and every room can convert into an intensive care unit for continuous critical care.
    </p>
    <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:12px;">
      The Westwood campus houses three hospitals under one roof: <strong>Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center</strong>, <strong>UCLA Mattel Children&#8217;s Hospital</strong>, and the <strong>Stewart &amp; Lynda Resnick Neuropsychiatric Hospital at UCLA</strong> (74 beds). The medical center operates a <strong>Level I Trauma Center</strong> (the highest designation from the American College of Surgeons), serves over <strong>50,000 emergency room patients per year</strong>, is a <strong>Magnet hospital for nursing excellence</strong>, and is a national leader in organ transplantation. UCLA Health earned top-10 national rankings in 10 specialties in 2025, including ear, nose &amp; throat (#2), pulmonology (#4), diabetes &amp; endocrinology (#5), ophthalmology (#5), psychiatry (#5), urology (#7), geriatrics (#7), GI/GI surgery (#8), rheumatology (#8), and orthopedics (#10).

      <li><strong>System:</strong> UCLA Health</li>

    </ul>
    <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:12px;">
      Because Westwood is on the Westside of Los Angeles and traffic between the San Fernando Valley and UCLA can be heavy, this facility is part of our Tier 2 service area. We factor additional travel and campus parking time into scheduling and pricing so we can arrive prepared and on time.

      <div>
        <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:12px;">
          We coordinate with you by phone or text to confirm the patient&#8217;s legal name, unit, and room number, as well as the documents that need notarization. Because the UCLA Health campus is large and spans multiple buildings, details like the correct tower, floor specialty, and elevator bank are very helpful.
        </p>
        <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:12px;">
          All visitors for inpatient visits must <strong>check in at the hospitality services information desk daily for a visitor badge</strong> &#8212; badges expire at midnight. Visitors must be symptom-free of any infectious disease. One overnight visitor per patient is allowed unless safe care is impacted. Minors must be accompanied by an adult and supervised at all times. Masks are recommended but not required in patient care areas. Pets are not allowed (service animals must be pre-approved by the nursing unit and badged at the hospitality desk).
        </p>
        <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:12px;">
          In the <strong>Emergency Department</strong>, 2 visitors are allowed for patients in rooms and 1 visitor for patients in hallway beds (2 visitors for pediatric patients). Visitors may be asked to leave if the department becomes overcrowded. Patients being admitted from the ER must have visitors re-badge at the main lobby desk before going to the inpatient room.
        </p>
        <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:12px;">
          The <strong>Resnick Neuropsychiatric Hospital</strong> has structured unit-specific visiting hours with 2 visitors per patient: <strong>4E</strong> &#8212; Mon&#8211;Fri 5:30&#8211;6:30 PM, Sat/Sun/holidays 2&#8211;4 PM &amp; 5:30&#8211;6:30 PM; <strong>4N</strong> &#8212; Mon&#8211;Fri 5&#8211;6 PM, Sat/Sun/holidays 4&#8211;6 PM; <strong>4W</strong> &#8212; Mon&#8211;Fri 6&#8211;7 PM, Sat/Sun/holidays 2&#8211;4 PM &amp; 6&#8211;7 PM. Visitation in semi-private rooms is staggered by unit staff.
        </p>
        <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:12px;">
          Westwood traffic and on-campus parking can be challenging, especially on weekdays and during UCLA events. <strong>Valet parking</strong> is available on Westwood Plaza at the hospital entrance, and visitor parking structures are available on campus. We include time for parking and navigating the campus in our arrival estimate and will text you when we are on-site so you know we are close.

      To keep your visit smooth, please have:
    </p>

    <ul style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.8; margin-left:18px; margin-bottom:16px;">
      <li>A valid, government-issued photo ID for each signer (driver license, state ID, passport, or other accepted identification)</li>

    <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:12px;">
      If the patient has limited mobility or is unable to sign in their usual way, let us know beforehand so we can discuss acceptable options under California notary law.
    </p>

    <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:12px;">
      If ID is at home, we recommend having a family member bring it to the hospital before the appointment. In some cases, credible witnesses may be an option; we will discuss this with you in advance based on California law.

        No. Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center is located at 757 Westwood Plaza on the main UCLA campus.

      <p class="faq-answer">
        For <strong>adult and pediatric inpatients, labor &amp; delivery patients, and NICU families</strong>: visitors must register at the information desk for a daily badge (badges expire at midnight) and be symptom-free. One overnight visitor per patient is allowed. There may be instances where visitation is limited due to space, safety, privacy, or clinical needs. In the NICU, children&#8217;s visits may be limited due to space constraints.<br><br>
        In the <strong>Emergency Department</strong>: 2 visitors for patients in rooms, 1 for hallway beds; 2 visitors for pediatric patients. Visitors may be asked to leave if overcrowded.<br><br>
        In the <strong>Resnick Neuropsychiatric Hospital</strong>: 2 visitors per patient on a structured schedule &#8212; 4E: Mon&#8211;Fri 5:30&#8211;6:30 PM, weekends/holidays 2&#8211;4 PM &amp; 5:30&#8211;6:30 PM; 4N: Mon&#8211;Fri 5&#8211;6 PM, weekends/holidays 4&#8211;6 PM; 4W: Mon&#8211;Fri 6&#8211;7 PM, weekends/holidays 2&#8211;4 PM &amp; 6&#8211;7 PM.<br><br>

      <p class="faq-question">How long does it take you to get to UCLA Westwood from Granada Hills?</p>
      <p class="faq-answer">
        Travel time to Westwood usually ranges from 35&#8211;60 minutes depending on traffic on the 405 and surface streets like Sunset Boulevard or Wilshire. During rush hour or when there are events on campus, it can take longer. We check real-time conditions before confirming your arrival window and keep you updated by text if delays are expected.
      </p>

      <p class="faq-question">Can you notarize documents for patients in specialized units like transplant, neurology, or oncology?</p>
      <p class="faq-answer">
        Yes. UCLA cares for many complex transplant, neurology, and oncology patients across specialized floors. Each floor of the 10-story building is dedicated to a medical specialty. We can visit these units as long as hospital visitor rules allow and the patient is alert enough to understand and sign the documents. We coordinate timing with family members and, when appropriate, the nursing staff to make sure the signing does not interfere with critical treatments or procedures.
      </p>

      <p class="faq-question">Does UCLA provide its own notary service?</p>
      <p class="faq-answer">
        Large academic medical centers sometimes have internal notary options, but availability is often limited and may not cover all document types. We operate as an independent mobile notary service that you hire directly. Families often call us when hospital-based notary options are unavailable, backlogged, or restricted to certain forms.
      </p>

      <p class="faq-question">Where do you park when coming to UCLA Westwood?</p>
      <p class="faq-answer">
        UCLA offers <strong>valet parking on Westwood Plaza</strong> at the hospital entrance (vehicle retrieval from the Valet Lobby on Level P) as well as visitor parking structures on campus. We typically use one of these options depending on availability. Parking fees and walking time are built into our arrival estimate so you do not have to worry about validating our parking. We will text you when we are parked and on the way up to the unit so you know when to expect us.
      </p>

      <p class="faq-question">Can you meet family members on campus rather than in the patient room?</p>
      <p class="faq-answer">
        Yes. If a document needs notarization but the patient is not the signer (for example, a family member signing a financial power of attorney), we can meet in a campus lobby, outdoor area, or another convenient spot. The medical center features open spaces, gardens, and gathering places throughout its 4-acre campus. We just need each signer to bring valid ID and appear in person. If documents involve both the patient and family members, we can coordinate a sequence that works best for everyone.
