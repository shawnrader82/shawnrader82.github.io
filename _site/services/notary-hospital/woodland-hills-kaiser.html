        <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:12px;">
          We coordinate with you by phone or text to confirm the patient&#8217;s legal name, room number, and the documents that need notarization. When we arrive, we check in at the main entrance or security, follow Kaiser visitor procedures, and then meet you in the patient room or a designated family area.
        </p>
        <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:12px;">
          <strong>Adult inpatient visiting hours</strong> at Kaiser Woodland Hills are <strong>Monday through Friday, 5:00 PM to 9:00 PM</strong> and <strong>weekends and holidays, 9:00 AM to 9:00 PM</strong>. Pediatric visiting hours are weekends and holidays 9:00 AM to 7:00 PM (Northside Building, 2nd Floor, Suite 260). All visitors must respect <strong>hospital quiet hours from 9:00 PM to 5:00 AM</strong> and meet hospital visitor requirements. The Labor &amp; Delivery and Mother &amp; Baby Care Suites have scheduled <strong>mother&#8209;baby quiet time every afternoon</strong> &#8212; plan accordingly if your signing involves a maternity patient.
        </p>
        <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:12px;">
          Our goal is to keep the visit calm, efficient, and respectful of doctors and nurses who may need access to the patient. If the patient is in a specialty unit, undergoing tests, or has visitor restrictions, let us know ahead of time so we can plan accordingly.
        </p>
        <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:12px;">
          The Kaiser Woodland Hills campus has a large <strong>multi-level parking structure</strong> adjacent to the Medical Office Tower as well as surface lots near the Northside Medical Offices. We factor parking and campus navigation time into our arrival estimate and will text you when we are on-site so you know we are close.

For legal questions or to decide which documents are appropriate for your situation, please consult a licensed attorney.

    <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:12px;">
      To keep your visit smooth, please have:
    </p>

    <ul style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.8; margin-left:18px; margin-bottom:16px;">
      <li>A valid, government-issued photo ID for each signer (driver license, state ID, passport, or other accepted identification)</li>
      <li>All pages of the documents printed and ready, not just the signature page (unless using our laptop/printer service)</li>
      <li>Any required witnesses who are not named in the document and who meet the hospital&#8217;s visitor rules</li>
    </ul>

    <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:12px;">
      If the patient has limited mobility or is unable to sign in their usual way, let us know beforehand so we can discuss acceptable options under California notary law.
    </p>

    <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:12px;">
      If ID is at home, we recommend having a family member bring it to the hospital before the appointment. In some cases, credible witnesses may be an option; we will discuss this with you in advance based on California law.

    <h2 style="font-size:22px; margin-bottom:10px;">Mobile notary FAQ for Kaiser Woodland Hills</h2>

    <div class="faq-block" style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6;">
      <p class="faq-question">Do I need to be a Kaiser member to use your notary service?</p>
      <p class="faq-answer">
        No. Our mobile notary service is independent from Kaiser Permanente. We come to the hospital to notarize documents for any patient or family member, regardless of their insurance or Kaiser membership status. You are hiring us directly as a mobile notary, not through the hospital.
      </p>

      <p class="faq-question">What are visiting hours at Kaiser Permanente Woodland Hills?</p>
      <p class="faq-answer">
        <strong>Adult inpatient</strong> visiting hours are Monday through Friday 5:00 PM to 9:00 PM, and weekends and holidays 9:00 AM to 9:00 PM. <strong>Pediatric</strong> visiting hours are weekends and holidays 9:00 AM to 7:00 PM (Northside Building, 2nd Floor, Suite 260). Hospital <strong>quiet hours</strong> are 9:00 PM to 5:00 AM &#8212; all visitors must respect quiet hours and meet hospital visitor requirements. The <strong>Labor &amp; Delivery and Mother &amp; Baby Care Suites</strong> have scheduled mother&#8209;baby quiet time every afternoon. We schedule our notary visit within these hours and coordinate with you on any unit-specific restrictions. For visiting policy questions, contact hospital registration or call (818) 719&#8209;2000.
      </p>

      <p class="faq-question">How quickly can you get to Kaiser Woodland Hills?</p>
      <p class="faq-answer">
        Kaiser Woodland Hills is within our Tier 1 service area. Travel time via the 101 or De Soto Avenue is typically 20&#8211;35 minutes from our Granada Hills base. During business hours, we can often arrive within 1&#8211;2 hours for urgent needs, or schedule same-day when our calendar allows. For planned signings, next-day appointments are typically available. We always confirm a specific arrival window when you book.
      </p>

      <p class="faq-question">Can you come to the Kaiser Woodland Hills campus even if the patient is in outpatient care?</p>
      <p class="faq-answer">
        Yes. While most hospital notarizations involve inpatients, we can also meet you at the Kaiser campus for outpatient situations if someone has limited mobility or is between appointments and cannot easily travel elsewhere. The campus includes the Medical Office Tower (Entrance A), Northside Medical Offices (Entrance N), the Surgi-Center, and Urgent Care. Let us know the building and department, and we will coordinate a convenient meeting spot.
      </p>

      <p class="faq-question">What if the patient is scheduled for surgery and needs documents signed beforehand?</p>
      <p class="faq-answer">
        Pre-surgery notarizations are common, especially for powers of attorney or healthcare directives. We recommend scheduling the signing at least a few hours before the procedure so there is no rush. The patient must be alert and not yet sedated when signing. Coordinate with the surgical team to confirm timing, and let us know the surgery schedule so we can arrive with enough buffer time.
      </p>

      <p class="faq-question">Where do I park when meeting a notary at Kaiser Woodland Hills?</p>
      <p class="faq-answer">
        The main campus at 5601 De Soto Avenue has a large multi-level parking structure adjacent to the Medical Office Tower, as well as surface lots near the Northside Medical Offices. If you are a visitor meeting us at the patient&#8217;s room, the parking structure is the easiest option. We handle our own parking and include that time in our arrival estimate. If you are waiting in a specific wing, let us know so we can text you when we are close and find you efficiently.
      </p>

      <p class="faq-question">Can Kaiser social workers or case managers be present during the signing?</p>
      <p class="faq-answer">
        Yes, hospital staff are welcome to be present if the patient or family prefers. Kaiser Woodland Hills has a dedicated Social Services department (818&#8209;719&#8209;3136) and continuing care team that often work with patients on discharge planning and related paperwork. However, whether staff can serve as official witnesses depends on the document. Some forms prohibit employees of the treating facility from witnessing. We will clarify witness requirements when you describe your documents, and you can arrange for independent witnesses if needed.
