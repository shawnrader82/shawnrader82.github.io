          <h3>Why inmates at Todd Road need notary services</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Family and custody matters</strong> — Guardianship, school authorizations, and visitation arrangements.</li>
            <li><strong>Financial and property decisions</strong> — Powers of attorney so relatives can manage bank accounts, bills, and property.</li>
            <li><strong>Court and legal paperwork</strong> — Declarations, affidavits, and other documents needed for active cases.</li>
            <li><strong>Real estate and vehicles</strong> — Deeds, titles, and other documents needed to manage homes, cars, and other assets.</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="service-detail-note" style="margin-top:12px;">
            Todd Road Jail and the Ventura County Main Jail (Pre‑Trial Detention Facility) share the same visiting
            guidelines and scheduling system but have separate visiting schedules and phone numbers. We confirm
            the correct facility before making the trip.

      <div class="service-detail-kicker">How it works</div>
      <h2>Scheduling a Notary Appointment at Todd Road Jail</h2>

      <div class="service-detail-grid">
        <div>
          <div class="faq-item" style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6;">
            <h3>1. Contact us with the inmate’s information</h3>
            <p>
              Call or text with the inmate’s full legal name, booking number (if known), and a description
              of the documents that need to be notarized. Let us know your deadline so we can prioritize
              scheduling.
            </p>

            <h3>2. We confirm Todd Road procedures</h3>
            <p>
              Ventura County facilities have specific visiting sessions by housing unit on Wednesday, Thursday,
              Saturday, and Sunday. We contact Todd Road Jail at (805) 654‑3335 to confirm the inmate’s
              availability and coordinate a professional visit, and verify the inmate is housed at Todd Road
              and not the Main Jail.
            </p>

            <h3>3. Prepare your documents</h3>
            <p>
              Have all documents ready and complete before the appointment — we cannot draft legal documents,
              only notarize signatures. If the inmate needs to review documents first, coordinate with their
              attorney or use the facility’s mail system.
            </p>
          </div>

            <h3>4. The notary appointment at Todd Road</h3>
            <p>
              We travel from Los Angeles to Todd Road Jail in Santa Paula (approximately 70 minutes via US‑101),
              clear security screening, and meet with the inmate in the designated visiting area. All visitors
              are subject to search, and no cell phones, wallets, or personal items are allowed in the visiting
              area. The inmate confirms their identity, signs the documents in our presence, and we complete
              the notarization.
            </p>

            <h3>5. Document delivery</h3>
            <p>
              After the appointment, we return the signed and notarized documents to you, your attorney,
              escrow company, or other designated recipient — by hand delivery, courier, or mail depending
              on your timeline.

      <div class="service-detail-kicker">Common Questions</div>
      <h2>Todd Road Jail Notary FAQs</h2>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Where is Todd Road Jail located?</h3>
        <p>
          Todd Road Jail is located at 600 Todd Rd, Santa Paula, CA 93060. It is approximately 70 minutes
          from Los Angeles via US‑101.
        </p>

        <h3>How do I confirm someone is housed at Todd Road Jail?</h3>
        <p>
          You can search the Ventura County Sheriff’s inmate locator online or call (805) 654‑3335.
          Be sure to confirm whether the inmate is at Todd Road or the Main Jail in Ventura, as they are
          separate facilities.
        </p>

        <h3>What are the visiting days and check-in rules at Todd Road?</h3>
        <p>
          Visiting days are Wednesday, Thursday, Saturday, and Sunday. Each visit is 30 minutes, with
          two visits per inmate per week. Check‑in starts 1 hour before and closes 30 minutes before
          the session ends.
        </p>

        <h3>What can I bring into Todd Road Jail during a visit?</h3>
        <p>
          Only your personal key ring, photo ID, and one baby bottle or blanket if bringing an infant.
          No cell phones, wallets, purses, backpacks, food, beverages, cameras, or reading materials
          are allowed. The facility does not hold items and there are no storage lockers.
        </p>

        <h3>What is the difference between Todd Road Jail and the Ventura County Main Jail?</h3>
        <p>
          The Main Jail (Pre‑Trial Detention Facility) in downtown Ventura primarily houses pre‑trial
          detainees and handles initial booking. Todd Road in Santa Paula primarily houses sentenced
          inmates and those in longer‑term custody, with different addresses and visiting schedules.
        </p>

        <h3>How long should I plan for a Todd Road notary appointment?</h3>
        <p>
          Plan for 3 to 4 hours total including travel from Los Angeles (approximately 70 minutes each
          way via US‑101), security screening, wait time, and the signing.
