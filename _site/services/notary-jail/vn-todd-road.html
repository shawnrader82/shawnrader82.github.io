      <h2>Scheduling a Notary Appointment at Todd Road</h2>
      <ol class="steps-list">
        <li>
          <h3>Contact us with the inmate&#39;s information</h3>
          <p>Call or text with the inmate&#39;s full legal name, booking number (if known), and a description of the documents that need to be notarized. Let us know your deadline so we can prioritize scheduling.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>We coordinate with the facility</h3>
          <p>Ventura County facilities have specific visiting sessions by housing unit on Wednesday, Thursday, Saturday, and Sunday. We contact Todd Road Jail at (805) 654-3335 to confirm the inmate&#39;s availability and coordinate a professional visit. We verify the inmate is housed at Todd Road and not the Main Jail before making the trip.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Prepare your documents</h3>
          <p>Have all documents ready and complete before the appointment &mdash; we cannot draft legal documents, only notarize signatures. If the inmate needs to review documents first, coordinate with their attorney or use the facility&#39;s mail system.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>The notary appointment</h3>
          <p>We travel from Los Angeles to Todd Road Jail in Santa Paula (approximately 70 minutes via US-101), clear security screening, and meet with the inmate in the designated visiting area. All visitors are subject to search. No cell phones, wallets, or personal items are allowed in the visiting area. The inmate confirms their identity, signs the documents in our presence, and we complete the notarization.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Document delivery</h3>
          <p>After the appointment, we return the signed and notarized documents to you, your attorney, escrow company, or other designated recipient &mdash; by hand delivery, courier, or mail depending on your timeline.</p>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p class="tip"><strong>Tip:</strong> Todd Road primarily houses sentenced inmates and those in longer-term custody. If the person was recently arrested, they are more likely at the Ventura County Main Jail (Pre-Trial Detention Facility) in downtown Ventura. Call us and we&#39;ll confirm the correct facility before scheduling.</p>
