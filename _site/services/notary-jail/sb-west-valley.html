      <div class="service-detail-grid">
        <div>
          <p class="service-detail-lead">
            The West Valley Detention Center in Rancho Cucamonga is one of the largest county jails in the
            State of California. Opened in 1991, it has a bed capacity of 3,347 and processes 50,000 to
            60,000 bookings and releases each year. WVDC houses primarily pre‑trial inmates and supports
            remote video court appearances for San Bernardino, Fontana, Rancho Cucamonga, Chino, Victorville,
            and Barstow courts. [file:286]
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Address:</strong> 9500 Etiwanda Ave, Rancho Cucamonga, CA 91739 (off the I‑15 freeway) [file:286]</li>
            <li><strong>Operated by:</strong> San Bernardino County Sheriff’s Department [file:286]</li>
            <li><strong>Bed capacity:</strong> 3,347 [file:286]</li>
            <li><strong>Annual bookings/releases:</strong> 50,000–60,000 per year [file:286]</li>
            <li><strong>Primary population:</strong> Pre‑trial inmates with video court appearances [file:286]</li>
            <li><strong>Approximate distance from Los Angeles:</strong> 50–70 minutes, depending on traffic [file:286]</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3>Why inmates at WVDC need notary services</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Court and legal filings</strong> — Declarations, affidavits, and other documents tied to criminal and civil cases.</li>
            <li><strong>Powers of attorney</strong> — Allowing family, friends, or attorneys to manage finances and property while the inmate is in custody.</li>
            <li><strong>Real estate and business documents</strong> — Deeds, escrow paperwork, and contracts tied to closing or funding dates.</li>
            <li><strong>Family and financial matters</strong> — Custody, support, and financial forms requiring notarized signatures.</li>
          </ul>
          <p style="font-size:13px; color:var(--text-muted); margin-top:10px;">
            Because WVDC is high‑volume and busy, early coordination helps secure professional visit times
            that line up with court and escrow deadlines. [file:286]

          <div class="faq-item" style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6;">
            <h3>1. Contact us with the inmate’s information</h3>
            <p>
              Call or text with the inmate’s full legal name, booking number (if known), and a description
              of the documents that need to be notarized. Let us know your deadline so we can prioritize
              scheduling. [file:286]
            </p>

            <h3>2. We confirm housing and professional visit rules</h3>
            <p>
              San Bernardino County facilities require visits to be scheduled at least one day in advance.
              We confirm current procedures, attorney/professional visiting availability, and ensure the
              inmate is housed at WVDC and not temporarily transferred. [file:286]
            </p>

            <h3>3. Prepare your documents</h3>
            <p>
              Have all documents ready and complete before the appointment — we cannot draft legal documents,
              only notarize signatures. If the inmate needs to review documents first, coordinate with their
              attorney or use the facility’s mail system. [file:286]

            <p>
              We travel from Los Angeles to WVDC in Rancho Cucamonga, clear security screening, and meet with
              the inmate in the designated professional visiting area. The inmate confirms their identity,
              signs the documents in our presence, and we complete the notarization. [file:286]

            <h3>5. Document delivery</h3>
            <p>
              After the appointment, we return the signed and notarized documents to you, your attorney,
              escrow company, or other designated recipient — by hand delivery, courier, or mail depending
              on your timeline. [file:286]

      <h2>West Valley Detention Center Notary FAQs</h2>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Where is West Valley Detention Center located?</h3>
        <p>
          WVDC is located at 9500 Etiwanda Ave, Rancho Cucamonga, CA 91739, just off the I‑15 freeway. It is
          approximately 50 to 70 minutes from Los Angeles depending on traffic. [file:286]
        </p>

        <h3>How large is West Valley Detention Center?</h3>
        <p>
          West Valley Detention Center is one of the largest county jails in California with a bed capacity
          of 3,347, processing 50,000 to 60,000 bookings and releases each year. [file:286]
        </p>

        <h3>How do I confirm someone is at West Valley Detention Center?</h3>
        <p>
          You can search the San Bernardino County Sheriff’s inmate locator online or call (909) 708‑8371
          with the inmate’s name and date of birth. [file:286]
        </p>

        <h3>What are the visiting hours at WVDC?</h3>
        <p>
          Public visiting hours are Wednesday through Saturday, 8:30 AM to 7:00 PM, by appointment only.
          Visits must be scheduled at least one day in advance by calling (909) 887‑0364 or using the online
          scheduling system. Attorneys may visit any day of the week. [file:286]
        </p>

        <h3>How is the inmate’s identity verified for notarization?</h3>
        <p>
          The facility maintains booking records with photos that can be used for identification. If the
          inmate has a valid California ID, driver’s license, or passport on file, that can also be used.
          We confirm ID options with the facility before the appointment. [file:286]
        </p>

        <h3>How long should I plan for a West Valley notary appointment?</h3>
        <p>
          Plan for 2 to 3 hours total including travel from Los Angeles to Rancho Cucamonga, security
          screening, wait time, and the signing. The notarization itself is quick, but travel and facility
          procedures add time. [file:286]
