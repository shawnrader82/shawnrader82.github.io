        <div>
          <div class="faq-item" style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6;">
            <h3>1. Contact us with the inmate’s information</h3>
            <p>
              Call or text with the inmate’s full legal name, booking number (if known), and a description
              of the documents that need to be notarized. Let us know your deadline so we can prioritize
              scheduling.
            </p>

            <h3>2. We schedule with the facility</h3>
            <p>
              Riverside County facilities require visits to be scheduled at least one day in advance. For
              attorney or professional visits at Southwest, we contact the facility directly at
              (951) 696‑3050 to coordinate. Because of the distance from Los Angeles, we plan the trip
              carefully to ensure timely arrival.
            </p>

            <h3>3. Prepare your documents</h3>
            <p>
              Have all documents ready and complete before the appointment — we cannot draft legal documents,
              only notarize signatures. If the inmate needs to review documents first, coordinate with their
              attorney or use the facility’s mail system.

            <h3>4. The notary appointment in Murrieta</h3>
            <p>
              We travel from Los Angeles to Southwest Detention Center in Murrieta (approximately 1.5 hours
              via I‑15), clear security screening, and meet with the inmate in the designated visiting area.
              The inmate confirms their identity, signs the documents in our presence, and we complete the
              notarization with the appropriate certificate.
            </p>

            <h3>5. Document delivery</h3>
            <p>
              After the appointment, we return the signed and notarized documents to you, your attorney,
              escrow company, or other designated recipient — by hand delivery, courier, or mail depending
              on your timeline.

    <div class="service-detail-inner">
      <div class="service-detail-kicker">Common Questions</div>
      <h2>Southwest Detention Center Notary FAQs (Cois M. Byrd)</h2>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Where is the Southwest Detention Center located?</h3>
        <p>
          Southwest Detention Center is located at 30755-B Auld Rd, Murrieta, CA 92563, in the French Valley
          area between Murrieta and Temecula. It is approximately 1.5 hours from Los Angeles via the I‑15
          freeway.
        </p>

        <h3>Is Southwest Detention Center the same as the Cois M. Byrd Detention Center?</h3>
        <p>
          Yes. The Southwest Detention Center and Cois M. Byrd Detention Center are the same facility, and
          it may be listed under either name in Riverside County inmate locator systems.
        </p>

        <h3>How do I confirm someone is at Southwest / Cois M. Byrd?</h3>
        <p>
          You can search the Riverside County Sheriff’s inmate locator online or call (951) 696‑3050 with
          the inmate’s name and date of birth to confirm they are housed at Southwest Detention Center.
        </p>

        <h3>How are visits scheduled at Southwest Detention Center?</h3>
        <p>
          You can call (951) 696‑3470 between 9:00 AM and 5:00 PM daily to schedule visits, and visits must
          be scheduled at least one day in advance. For attorney or professional visits, the facility is
          contacted at (951) 696‑3050 to coordinate directly.
        </p>

        <h3>Does Southwest house male and female inmates?</h3>
        <p>
          No. Southwest Detention Center houses male inmates only. If you are looking for a female inmate
          in Riverside County, check the Robert Presley Detention Center or contact the Riverside County
          Sheriff for guidance.
        </p>

        <h3>How long should I plan for a Southwest Detention Center notary appointment?</h3>
        <p>
          Plan for 4 to 5 hours total including travel from Los Angeles (approximately 1.5 hours each way
          via I‑15), security screening, wait time, and the signing. The notarization itself is quick, but
          travel and facility procedures add time.
