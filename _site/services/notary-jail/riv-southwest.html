      <ol class="steps-list">
        <li>
          <h3>Contact us with the inmate&#39;s information</h3>
          <p>Call or text with the inmate&#39;s full legal name, booking number (if known), and a description of the documents that need to be notarized. Let us know your deadline so we can prioritize scheduling.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>We coordinate with the facility</h3>
          <p>Riverside County facilities require visits to be scheduled at least one day in advance. For attorney or professional visits at Southwest, we contact the facility directly at (951) 696-3050 to coordinate. Due to the distance from Los Angeles, we plan the trip carefully to ensure timely arrival.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Prepare your documents</h3>
          <p>Have all documents ready and complete before the appointment &mdash; we cannot draft legal documents, only notarize signatures. If the inmate needs to review documents first, coordinate with their attorney or use the facility&#39;s mail system.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>The notary appointment</h3>
          <p>We travel from Los Angeles to Southwest Detention Center in Murrieta (approximately 1.5 hours via I-15), clear security screening, and meet with the inmate in the designated visiting area. The inmate confirms their identity, signs the documents in our presence, and we complete the notarization.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Document delivery</h3>
          <p>After the appointment, we return the signed and notarized documents to you, your attorney, escrow company, or other designated recipient &mdash; by hand delivery, courier, or mail depending on your timeline.</p>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p class="tip"><strong>Tip:</strong> The Southwest Detention Center is also known as the Cois M. Byrd Detention Center. If you&#39;re searching for an inmate, try both names in the Riverside County inmate locator. This facility houses male inmates only.</p>
