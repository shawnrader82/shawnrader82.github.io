            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Financial and property decisions</strong> — Powers of attorney so trusted
              relatives can manage bank accounts, bills, and property.

            <li>
              <strong>Marriage, divorce, and support</strong> — Paperwork related to marriage, legal

            <p class="faq-answer">
              Call or text with the inmate's full legal name, booking number (if known), and a description
              of the documents that need to be notarized. Let us know your deadline or any upcoming
              court dates.
            </p>

            <p class="faq-question">2. We confirm CRDF procedures</p>
            <p class="faq-answer">
              Century Regional Detention Facility has its own schedule and rules for professional visits.
              We confirm the current procedures, visiting hours, and any approvals needed for a notary
              to meet with the inmate.
            </p>

            <p class="faq-question">3. Prepare your documents</p>
            <p class="faq-answer">
              Have all documents ready and complete before the appointment — we cannot draft legal documents,
              only notarize signatures. If the inmate needs to review documents first, coordinate with
              their attorney or use the facility's mail system.

            <p class="faq-answer">
              We travel to CRDF, clear security screening, and meet with the inmate in the designated
              professional visiting area. The inmate confirms her identity, signs the documents in
              our presence, and we complete the notarization with the appropriate certificate.

            <p class="faq-answer">
              After the appointment, we return the signed and notarized documents to you, your attorney,
              court, or other designated recipient — by hand delivery in the LA area, courier,
              or mail depending on your timeline.

      <h2>CRDF Lynwood Notary FAQs</h2>

      <div class="faq-block">
        <p class="faq-question">How do I confirm someone is at CRDF Lynwood?</p>
        <p class="faq-answer">
          You can search the LA County Sheriff's Inmate Information Center online at
          <a href="https://app5.lasd.org/iic/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">app5.lasd.org/iic</a>
          using the inmate's name and date of birth. The system will list Century Regional
          Detention Facility if that is her current location.
        </p>

        <p class="faq-question">Can CRDF notarizations help with child custody or guardianship?</p>
        <p class="faq-answer">
          Yes. Many appointments at CRDF involve documents related to child custody, temporary
          guardianship, and school or medical authorizations. We work with you and, if needed,
          your attorney to ensure the documents are ready to sign.
        </p>

        <p class="faq-question">Can I bring the documents to CRDF myself?</p>
        <p class="faq-answer">
          Professional notary visits are separate from regular family visitation. You will need to
          get documents to us before the appointment, and we will bring them into the facility and
          return them after notarization.
        </p>

        <p class="faq-question">What ID does the inmate need?</p>
        <p class="faq-answer">
          CRDF maintains booking records with photos that can be used for identification purposes.
          If the inmate has a valid California ID, driver's license, or passport on file, that can
          also be used. We confirm ID options before the appointment.
        </p>

        <p class="faq-question">How far in advance should I schedule a CRDF appointment?</p>
        <p class="faq-answer">
          Whenever possible, contact us several days before your deadline so we can coordinate a
          time that works with the facility's schedule. For urgent situations, call or text as soon
          as you know you need the appointment and we will review options.
        </p>

        <p class="faq-question">What if the inmate is moved to another jail?</p>
        <p class="faq-answer">
          Women may sometimes be transferred between CRDF and other facilities. We recommend confirming
          her location close to the appointment time. If she has been moved, we can usually reschedule
          for the new facility with an updated quote if travel distance changes.
