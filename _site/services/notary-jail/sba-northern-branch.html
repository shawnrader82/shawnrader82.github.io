      <h2>Scheduling a notary appointment at Northern Branch Jail</h2>
      <ol class="steps-list">
        <li>
          <h3>Share the inmate&#39;s information and documents</h3>
          <p>Call or text with the inmate&#39;s full legal name, booking or CID number if available, and a description of the documents to be notarized. Let us know your deadline so we can prioritize scheduling.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>We coordinate with the Northern Branch</h3>
          <p>We contact the Northern Branch Jail to confirm housing location, current visiting procedures, and how professional visits are handled. We work within the ViaPath scheduling framework and coordinate with the watch commander or designated staff to arrange the notary visit.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Prepare your documents</h3>
          <p>Have all documents complete and ready before the appointment. We cannot draft legal documents or provide legal advice &mdash; our role is to verify identity, witness signatures, and complete the notarization. If the inmate needs to review documents ahead of time, coordinate with their attorney or send copies through the jail&#39;s mail or email systems.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>The notary appointment at the facility</h3>
          <p>We travel from Los Angeles to Santa Maria, check in with custody staff, and are escorted to the designated visiting area. The inmate confirms their identity, signs the documents in our presence, and we complete the notarial certificate.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Returning the signed and notarized documents</h3>
          <p>After the visit, we return the originals to you, your attorney, a title or escrow company, or any other designated recipient. Depending on your deadlines, we can hand-deliver locally, overnight by courier, or return by mail.</p>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p class="tip"><strong>Tip:</strong> The Northern Branch Jail is approximately 2.5 hours from Los Angeles. This is our farthest regularly served facility &mdash; please give as much lead time as possible. That said, we accommodate urgent requests whenever we can.</p>
