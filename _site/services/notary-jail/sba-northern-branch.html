            The Northern Branch Jail is a 376‑bed facility located at 2301 Black Road, Santa Maria, CA 93455.
            Operated by the Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Office, it houses male and female inmates in
            medium and high‑security housing units and serves as a major hub for county inmate housing and
            social visiting.

            the ViaPath scheduling system. This facility is separate from the Santa Barbara County Main Jail
            on Calle Real in Santa Barbara — the two are about 65 miles apart, so confirming the correct
            facility before scheduling is essential.

          <div class="faq-item" style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6;">
            <h3>1. Contact us with the inmate’s information</h3>
            <p>
              Call or text with the inmate’s full legal name, booking or CID number if available, and a
              description of the documents to be notarized. Let us know your deadline so we can prioritize
              scheduling.
            </p>

            <h3>2. We coordinate with Northern Branch staff</h3>
            <p>
              We contact the Northern Branch Jail to confirm housing location, current visiting procedures,
              and how professional visits are handled. We work within the ViaPath scheduling framework and
              coordinate with the watch commander or designated staff to arrange the notary visit.
            </p>

            <h3>3. Prepare your documents</h3>
            <p>
              Have all documents complete and ready before the appointment. We cannot draft legal documents
              or provide legal advice — our role is to verify identity, witness signatures, and complete the
              notarization. If the inmate needs to review documents ahead of time, coordinate with their
              attorney or use the jail’s mail or email systems.

              We travel from Los Angeles to Santa Maria, check in with custody staff, and are escorted to the
              designated visiting area. The inmate confirms their identity, signs the documents in our
              presence, and we complete the notarial certificate according to California law.
            </p>

            <h3>5. Document delivery</h3>
            <p>
              After the visit, we return the originals to you, your attorney, a title or escrow company, or
              any other designated recipient. Depending on your deadlines, we can hand‑deliver locally,
              overnight by courier, or return by mail.

    <div class="service-detail-inner">
      <div class="service-detail-kicker">Common Questions</div>
      <h2>Northern Branch Jail Notary FAQs (Santa Maria)</h2>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Where is the Northern Branch Jail located?</h3>
        <p>
          The Northern Branch Jail is located at 2301 Black Road, Santa Maria, CA 93455. It is a 376‑bed
          Santa Barbara County facility that houses male and female inmates in medium and high‑security
          housing units.
        </p>

        <h3>Can a mobile notary visit the Northern Branch Jail?</h3>
        <p>
          Yes. Independent mobile notaries can provide services at the Northern Branch Jail. The notary
          coordinates with the watch commander, checks in with custody staff, and completes the notarization
          during a professional visit.
        </p>

        <h3>What are the visiting hours and scheduling rules?</h3>
        <p>
          The Northern Branch Jail offers visits Sunday through Saturday, 8:00 AM to 5:00 PM. Visits are
          scheduled through the ViaPath online registration system, appointments start on the hour, and
          visitors should check in 15 to 30 minutes before their scheduled time.
        </p>

        <h3>How many visits are inmates allowed at Northern Branch?</h3>
        <p>
          Inmates at the Northern Branch Jail are generally allowed up to four visits per week. All visitors
          must be on the inmate’s approved visitor list and must check in with the same photo ID used to
          register online.
        </p>

        <h3>Is the Northern Branch Jail the same as the Main Jail?</h3>
        <p>
          No. The Northern Branch Jail in Santa Maria and the Main Jail on Calle Real in Santa Barbara are
          separate facilities about 65 miles apart. Both are operated by the Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s
          Office, and many social visits for county inmates are handled at the Northern Branch.
        </p>

        <h3>How long should I plan for a Northern Branch notary appointment?</h3>
        <p>
          Plan for 5 to 7 hours total, including travel from Los Angeles to Santa Maria (approximately 2.5
          hours each way), check‑in with custody staff, wait time, and the signing itself. The notarization
          portion is quick, but the distance adds significant travel time.
        </p>

        <h3>How do I confirm someone is at the Northern Branch Jail?</h3>
        <p>
          You can search the Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Office inmate locator online or call the
          Northern Branch Jail at (805) 554‑3100 with the inmate’s name and date of birth.
