            <h3>1. Contact us with the inmate&#8217;s information</h3>
            <p>
              Call or text with the inmate&#8217;s full legal name, booking number (if known), and a description
              of the documents that need to be notarized. Let us know your deadline so we can prioritize scheduling.
            </p>

            <h3>2. We coordinate with the facility</h3>
            <p>
              San Bernardino County facilities require professional visits to be scheduled in advance. We confirm
              current procedures, visiting availability, and ensure the inmate is still housed at Glen Helen and
              not temporarily transferred.
            </p>

            <h3>3. Prepare your documents</h3>
            <p>
              Have all documents ready and complete before the appointment &#8212; we cannot draft legal documents,
              only notarize signatures. If the inmate needs to review documents first, coordinate with their
              attorney or use the facility&#8217;s mail system.

            <p>
              We travel from Los Angeles to Glen Helen in Devore, clear security screening, and meet with the inmate
              in the designated visiting area. The inmate confirms their identity, signs the documents in our presence,
              and we complete the notarization with the appropriate certificate.
            </p>

            <h3>5. Document delivery</h3>
            <p>
              After the appointment, we return the signed and notarized documents to you, your attorney, escrow
              company, or other designated recipient &#8212; by hand delivery, courier, or mail depending on your timeline.
