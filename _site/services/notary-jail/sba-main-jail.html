          <p class="service-detail-lead">
            The Santa Barbara County Main Jail is located at 4436 Calle Real, Santa Barbara, CA 93110 and is
            operated by the Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Office. It houses male and female inmates who are
            awaiting trial, sentencing, or serving county jail sentences, and provides medical, nutritional,
            legal, and rehabilitative services during incarceration.
          </p>

          <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6;">
            Santa Barbara County also operates the Northern Branch Jail in Santa Maria, a separate 376‑bed
            facility roughly 65 miles north of the Main Jail. Before scheduling a notary visit, it is
            important to confirm whether the inmate is housed at the Calle Real Main Jail or the Northern
            Branch Jail on Black Road in Santa Maria.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Main Jail (Calle Real):</strong> Primary county jail in Santa Barbara</li>
            <li><strong>Northern Branch Jail:</strong> Separate facility in Santa Maria</li>

      <div class="service-detail-grid">
        <div>
          <div class="faq-item" style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6;">
            <h3>1. Contact us with the inmate’s information</h3>
            <p>
              Call or text with the inmate’s full legal name, booking or CID number if available, and a
              description of the documents to be notarized. Let us know your deadline so we can prioritize
              scheduling.
            </p>

            <h3>2. We confirm the facility and procedures</h3>
            <p>
              We contact the Main Jail to confirm housing location, current visiting procedures, and how
              professional visits are handled. We verify that the inmate is at the Calle Real Main Jail and
              not at the Northern Branch Jail in Santa Maria.
            </p>

            <h3>3. Prepare your documents</h3>
            <p>
              Have all documents complete and ready before the appointment. We cannot draft legal documents
              or provide legal advice — our role is to verify identity, witness signatures, and complete the
              notarization. If the inmate needs to review documents ahead of time, coordinate with their
              attorney or send copies through the jail’s mail or email systems.

            <h3>4. The notary appointment in Santa Barbara</h3>
            <p>
              We travel from Los Angeles to Santa Barbara, check in with custody staff, and are escorted to
              a non‑contact visiting area. The inmate confirms their identity, signs the documents in our
              presence, and we complete the notarial certificate according to California law.
            </p>

            <h3>5. Document delivery</h3>
            <p>
              After the visit, we return the originals to you, your attorney, a title or escrow company, or
              any other designated recipient. Depending on your deadlines, we can hand‑deliver locally,
              overnight by courier, or return by mail.

  <!-- FAQ -->
  <section class="service-detail service-detail--gray" id="santa-barbara-main-jail-notary-faq">
    <div class="service-detail-inner">
      <div class="service-detail-kicker">Common Questions</div>
      <h2>Santa Barbara County Main Jail Notary FAQs</h2>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Where is the Santa Barbara County Main Jail located?</h3>
        <p>
          The Main Jail is located at 4436 Calle Real, Santa Barbara, CA 93110. It is the county’s primary
          jail and houses male and female inmates awaiting trial or serving county sentences.
        </p>

        <h3>Do mobile notaries work at the Santa Barbara Main Jail?</h3>
        <p>
          Yes. Independent mobile notaries regularly provide services at the Santa Barbara County Main Jail.
          The notary checks in with custody staff, is escorted to a non‑contact visiting area, and completes
          the notarization with the inmate.
        </p>

        <h3>How is the inmate’s identity verified for notarization?</h3>
        <p>
          Custody staff maintain booking records with photos and identifying information that can be used to
          confirm the inmate’s identity. If the inmate has a valid government‑issued ID on file, that can
          also be used. We confirm ID options with the facility before the appointment.
        </p>

        <h3>How long should I plan for a Main Jail notary appointment?</h3>
        <p>
          Plan for 3 to 5 hours total, including travel from Los Angeles, check‑in with custody staff,
          escort to and from the visiting area, wait time, and the signing itself. The notarization portion
          is quick, but facility procedures and distance add time.
        </p>

        <h3>Is the Northern Branch Jail the same as the Main Jail?</h3>
        <p>
          No. The Main Jail on Calle Real in Santa Barbara and the Northern Branch Jail on Black Road in
          Santa Maria are separate facilities about 65 miles apart. Both are operated by the Santa Barbara
          County Sheriff’s Office, so be sure you know which facility the inmate is housed at before
          scheduling.
        </p>

        <h3>How do I confirm someone is at the Santa Barbara Main Jail?</h3>
        <p>
          You can search the Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Office inmate locator online or call the Main
          Jail at (805) 681‑4260 with the inmate’s name and date of birth.

        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Yes. Independent mobile notaries regularly provide services at the Santa Barbara County Main Jail. The notary checks in with custody staff, is escorted to a non-contact visiting area, and completes the notarization with the inmate."

        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Custody staff maintain booking records with photos and identifying information that can be used to confirm the inmate's identity. If the inmate has a valid government-issued ID on file, that can also be used. ID options are confirmed with the facility before the appointment."

        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Plan for 3 to 5 hours total, including travel from Los Angeles, check-in with custody staff, escort to and from the visiting area, wait time, and the signing itself. The notarization portion is quick, but facility procedures and distance add time."

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "No. The Main Jail on Calle Real in Santa Barbara and the Northern Branch Jail on Black Road in Santa Maria are separate facilities about 65 miles apart. Both are operated by the Santa Barbara County Sheriff's Office, so it is important to confirm which facility the inmate is housed at before scheduling."
