  <section class="service-detail-section">
    <div class="container">
      <h2>Scheduling a notary appointment at Santa Barbara County Jail</h2>
      <ol class="steps-list">
        <li>
          <h3>Share the inmate&#39;s information and documents</h3>
          <p>Call or text with the inmate&#39;s full legal name, booking or CID number if available, and a description of the documents to be notarized. Let us know your deadline so we can prioritize scheduling.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>We coordinate with custody staff</h3>
          <p>We contact the Main Jail to confirm housing location, current visiting procedures, and how professional visits are handled. We confirm the inmate is at the Calle Real facility and not the Northern Branch Jail in Santa Maria.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Prepare your documents</h3>
          <p>Have all documents complete and ready before the appointment. We cannot draft legal documents or provide legal advice &mdash; our role is to verify identity, witness signatures, and complete the notarization. If the inmate needs to review documents ahead of time, coordinate with their attorney or send copies through the jail&#39;s mail or email systems.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>The notary appointment at the jail</h3>
          <p>We travel from Los Angeles to Santa Barbara, check in with custody staff, and are escorted to a non-contact visiting area. The inmate confirms their identity, signs the documents in our presence, and we complete the notarial certificate.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Returning the signed and notarized documents</h3>
          <p>After the visit, we return the originals to you, your attorney, a title or escrow company, or any other designated recipient. Depending on your deadlines, we can hand-deliver locally, overnight by courier, or return by mail.</p>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p class="tip"><strong>Tip:</strong> Santa Barbara is approximately 1.5&ndash;2 hours from Los Angeles. The more lead time you can give us, the easier it is to coordinate with the facility. That said, we accommodate urgent requests whenever possible.</p>
