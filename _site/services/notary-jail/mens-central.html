      <div class="service-detail-grid">
        <div>
          <p class="service-detail-lead">
            Men's Central Jail (MCJ) is the largest jail facility in Los Angeles County and one of the
            largest in the United States. Located in downtown Los Angeles near Union Station, MCJ houses
            thousands of male inmates awaiting trial or serving shorter sentences.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Address:</strong> 441 Bauchet Street, Los Angeles, CA 90012</li>
            <li><strong>Operated by:</strong> Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department</li>
            <li><strong>Location:</strong> Downtown Los Angeles, near the Twin Towers facility</li>
            <li><strong>Parking:</strong> Limited street parking; plan extra time for security screening</li>

        <div>
          <h3>Why inmates at MCJ need notary services</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Time-sensitive legal matters</strong> — Court deadlines, property transactions, and
              family emergencies do not wait for someone's release date.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Power of attorney</strong> — Authorizing a spouse, family member, or attorney to
              handle finances, property, or legal matters while in custody.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Real estate transactions</strong> — Signing deeds, refinancing documents, or
              property transfers that cannot be delayed.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Family law documents</strong> — Divorce paperwork, custody agreements, and child
              support modifications that require both parties' signatures.

          <div class="faq-block" style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6;">
            <p class="faq-question">1. Contact us with the inmate's information</p>
            <p class="faq-answer">
              Call or text with the inmate's full legal name, booking number (if known), and a description
              of the documents that need to be notarized. Let us know your deadline so we can prioritize
              scheduling.
            </p>

            <p class="faq-question">2. We coordinate with MCJ</p>
            <p class="faq-answer">
              Men's Central Jail has specific procedures for professional visits. We confirm visiting
              hours, any advance scheduling requirements, and ensure the inmate is available and housed
              at MCJ (not temporarily transferred for court or medical reasons).
            </p>

            <p class="faq-question">3. Prepare your documents</p>
            <p class="faq-answer">
              Have all documents ready and complete before the appointment — we cannot draft legal documents,
              only notarize signatures. If the inmate needs to review documents first, coordinate with their
              attorney or use the facility's mail system to get documents to them in advance.

            <p class="faq-question">4. The notary appointment</p>
            <p class="faq-answer">
              We arrive at MCJ, clear security screening, and meet with the inmate in the designated
              professional visiting area. The inmate confirms their identity, signs the documents in
              our presence, and we complete the notarization with the appropriate certificate.
            </p>

            <p class="faq-question">5. Document delivery</p>
            <p class="faq-answer">
              After the appointment, we return the signed and notarized documents to you, your attorney,
              escrow company, or other designated recipient — by hand delivery in the LA area, courier,
              or mail depending on your timeline.

      <div class="service-detail-kicker">Common Questions</div>
      <h2>Men's Central Jail Notary FAQs</h2>

      <div class="faq-block">
        <p class="faq-question">How do I find someone's booking number at MCJ?</p>
        <p class="faq-answer">
          You can search the LA County Sheriff's Inmate Information Center online at
          <a href="https://app5.lasd.org/iic/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">app5.lasd.org/iic</a>
          using the inmate's name and date of birth. The booking number helps us confirm their
          location and coordinate the visit.
        </p>

        <p class="faq-question">What if the inmate was just transferred to MCJ?</p>
        <p class="faq-answer">
          After a transfer, it can take 24–48 hours for an inmate to be fully processed and available
          for professional visits. We recommend confirming their status before scheduling if there
          has been a recent transfer.
        </p>

        <p class="faq-question">Can family members bring the documents to the appointment?</p>
        <p class="faq-answer">
          No — professional notary visits are separate from regular family visitation. You will need
          to get documents to us before the appointment, and we will bring them into the facility.
          After notarization, we return them to you or your designated recipient.
        </p>

        <p class="faq-question">What ID does the inmate need?</p>
        <p class="faq-answer">
          MCJ maintains booking records with photos that can be used for identification purposes.
          If the inmate has a valid California ID, driver's license, or passport on file, that can
          also be used. We confirm ID options before the appointment.
        </p>

        <p class="faq-question">How long does the appointment take?</p>
        <p class="faq-answer">
          Plan for 1–2 hours total including travel, security screening, wait time, and the actual
          signing. The notarization itself is quick, but jail procedures add time. We build this
          into our scheduling so you know what to expect.
        </p>

        <p class="faq-question">What if the inmate refuses to sign?</p>
        <p class="faq-answer">
          A notary cannot force anyone to sign a document. If the inmate refuses or is unable to
          sign (for example, due to competency concerns), the notarization cannot be completed.
          You may still be responsible for a trip fee in this situation.
