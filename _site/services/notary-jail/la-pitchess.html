            Peter J. Pitchess Detention Center (also known as Wayside Jail) is the county’s largest and
            oldest operating jail complex, situated on a 2,620‑acre property in Castaic off Interstate 5.
            The complex houses over 8,000 inmates across multiple facilities.
          </p>

          <h3>Facilities on the Pitchess property</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>North Facility (PDC North):</strong> 29320 The Old Road — maximum security, 1,648 beds; watch commander (661) 295‑8059</li>
            <li><strong>South Facility (PDC South):</strong> 29330 The Old Road — includes fire camp program; watch commander (661) 295‑8011</li>

          <h3>Why inmates at Pitchess need notary services</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Longer stays in custody</strong> — Many inmates housed at Pitchess are serving sentences or staying for longer periods, increasing the need to manage life and finances from inside.</li>
            <li><strong>Property and vehicle matters</strong> — Signing deeds, titles, and other documents so family members can sell or manage property and vehicles.</li>
            <li><strong>Family and financial decisions</strong> — Powers of attorney and authorizations so trusted relatives can handle banking, benefits, and children’s needs.</li>
            <li><strong>Court and legal filings</strong> — Declarations, affidavits, and other documents needed for active cases.</li>

          <div class="faq-item" style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6;">
            <h3>1. Contact us with the inmate’s information</h3>
            <p>
              Call or text with the inmate’s full legal name, booking number (if known), and a description
              of the documents that need to be notarized. Let us know if they are at Pitchess or North County
              Correctional Facility, if you already know.
            </p>

            <h3>2. We confirm the exact facility and procedures</h3>
            <p>
              The Castaic jail complex includes multiple facilities with different visiting procedures.
              We confirm where the inmate is actually housed and what the rules are for professional visits
              at that specific unit.
            </p>

            <h3>3. Prepare your documents</h3>
            <p>
              Have all documents ready and complete before the appointment — we cannot draft legal documents,
              only notarize signatures. If the inmate needs to review documents first, coordinate with their
              attorney or mail the documents to the facility in advance.
            </p>

            <h3>4. The notary appointment in Castaic</h3>
            <p>
              We travel to the Castaic facility, clear security at the visitor center, and meet with the inmate
              in the designated professional visiting area. The inmate confirms their identity, signs the
              documents in our presence, and we complete the notarization with the appropriate certificate.
            </p>

            <h3>5. Document delivery</h3>
            <p>
              After the appointment, we return the signed and notarized documents to you, your attorney,
              escrow company, or other designated recipient — by hand delivery in the LA area, courier,
              or mail depending on your timeline.

            Notary appointments at Pitchess and the nearby Castaic jail facilities involve longer travel
            times and coordination. Pricing reflects the distance from central Los Angeles and the time

          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Pitchess / Castaic appointments:</strong> Typically higher than downtown LA jail visits due to distance</li>

    <div class="service-detail-inner">
      <div class="service-detail-kicker">Common Questions</div>
      <h2>Pitchess Detention Center Notary FAQs</h2>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>How do I know if someone is at Pitchess or North County?</h3>
        <p>
          You can search the LA County Sheriff’s Inmate Information Center online at
          <a href="https://app5.lasd.org/iic/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">app5.lasd.org/iic</a>
          using the inmate’s name and date of birth. The system will list the current facility, which may
          be one of the Pitchess units or North County Correctional Facility.
        </p>

        <h3>Can you visit more than one Castaic facility on the same trip?</h3>
        <p>
          In some cases, yes. If you have documents for inmates housed at different Castaic facilities,
          let us know. We can discuss whether it is practical to coordinate multiple visits on the same
          day, subject to facility schedules.
        </p>

        <h3>Do Castaic facilities have different visiting rules than downtown LA jails?</h3>
        <p>
          Yes. Each facility has its own schedule and rules for professional visits. For example, PDC South
          may allow professional visits daily from 8:00 AM to 10:00 PM, while PDC North may allow visits
          Monday–Friday during certain hours. We confirm the current procedures for the specific unit
          before your appointment.
        </p>

        <h3>How far in advance should I schedule a Pitchess appointment?</h3>
        <p>
          Because of the travel time and coordination involved, we recommend contacting us at least a few
          days in advance when possible. For urgent matters, call or text as soon as you know you need
          the appointment and we will see what options are available.
        </p>

        <h3>What ID does the inmate need?</h3>
        <p>
          Castaic facilities maintain booking records with photos that can be used for identification
          purposes. If the inmate has a valid California ID, driver’s license, or passport on file, that
          can also be used. We confirm ID options before the appointment.
        </p>

        <h3>What if the inmate is moved back to downtown LA?</h3>
        <p>
          Inmates can be transferred between Castaic and downtown facilities. We recommend confirming the
          inmate’s location close to the appointment time. If they have been moved, we can usually
          reschedule for the new facility (downtown or Castaic) with an updated quote if travel distance
          changes.
