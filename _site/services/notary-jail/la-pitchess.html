          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Longer stays in custody</strong> &#8212; Many inmates housed at Pitchess are serving
              sentences or staying for longer periods, which increases the need to manage life
              and finances from inside.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Property and vehicle matters</strong> &#8212; Signing deeds, titles, and other documents
              so family members can sell or manage property and vehicles.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Family and financial decisions</strong> &#8212; Powers of attorney and authorizations
              so trusted relatives can handle banking, benefits, and children&#8217;s needs.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Court and legal filings</strong> &#8212; Declarations, affidavits, and other documents
              needed for active cases.

            <p>
              Call or text with the inmate&#8217;s full legal name, booking number (if known), and a description
              of the documents that need to be notarized. Let us know if they are at Pitchess or North
              County Correctional Facility, if you already know.

            <h3>2. We confirm the exact facility and procedures</p>
            <p>
              The Castaic jail complex includes multiple facilities with different visiting procedures.
              We confirm where the inmate is actually housed and what the rules are for professional
              visits at that specific unit.
            </p>

            <h3>3. Prepare your documents</p>

              Have all documents ready and complete before the appointment &#8212; we cannot draft legal documents,
              only notarize signatures. If the inmate needs to review documents first, coordinate with
              their attorney or mail the documents to the facility in advance.

              We travel to the Castaic facility, clear security at the visitor center, and meet with
              the inmate in the designated professional visiting area. The inmate confirms their identity,
              signs the documents in our presence, and we complete the notarization with the appropriate
              certificate.

      <h2>Pitchess Detention Center Notary FAQs</h2>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>How do I know if someone is at Pitchess or North County?</p>
        <p>
          You can search the LA County Sheriff&#8217;s Inmate Information Center online at
          <a href="https://app5.lasd.org/iic/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">app5.lasd.org/iic</a>
          using the inmate&#8217;s name and date of birth. The system will list the current facility,
          which may be one of the Pitchess units or North County Correctional Facility.
        </p>

        <h3>Can you visit more than one Castaic facility on the same trip?</p>
        <p>
          In some cases, yes. If you have documents for inmates housed at different Castaic
          facilities, let us know. We can discuss whether it is practical to coordinate multiple
          visits on the same day.
        </p>

        <h3>Do Castaic facilities have different visiting rules than downtown LA jails?</p>
        <p>
          Yes. Each facility has its own schedule and rules for professional visits. For example,
          PDC South allows professional visits daily from 8:00 AM to 10:00 PM, while PDC North
          allows professional visits Monday&#8211;Friday 8:00 AM to 8:00 PM. We confirm
          the current procedures for the specific unit before your appointment.
        </p>

        <h3>How far in advance should I schedule a Pitchess appointment?</p>
        <p>
          Because of the travel time and coordination involved, we recommend contacting us at least
          a few days in advance when possible. For urgent matters, call or text as soon as you know
          you need the appointment and we will see what options are available.
        </p>

        <h3>What ID does the inmate need?</p>
        <p>
          Castaic facilities maintain booking records with photos that can be used for identification
          purposes. If the inmate has a valid California ID, driver&#8217;s license, or passport on file,
          that can also be used. We confirm ID options before the appointment.
        </p>

        <h3>What if the inmate is moved back to downtown LA?</p>
        <p>
          Inmates can be transferred between Castaic and downtown facilities. We recommend confirming
          the inmate&#8217;s location close to the appointment time. If they have been moved, we can
          usually reschedule for the new facility (downtown or Castaic) with an updated quote if
          travel distance changes.
