            <h3>1. Contact us with the inmate’s information</h3>
            <p>
              Call or text with the inmate’s full legal name, booking number (if known), and a description
              of the documents that need to be notarized. Let us know your deadline so we can prioritize
              scheduling.
            </p>

            <h3>2. We coordinate with the Benoit Detention Center</h3>
            <p>
              We confirm the current visiting procedures for professional notary visits, any advance
              scheduling requirements, and ensure the inmate is available and housed at the John J. Benoit
              Detention Center (not temporarily transferred for court or medical reasons).
            </p>

            <h3>3. Prepare your documents</h3>
            <p>
              Have all documents ready and complete before the appointment — we cannot draft legal documents,
              only notarize signatures. If the inmate needs to review documents first, coordinate with their
              attorney or use the facility’s mail system.

            <h3>4. The notary appointment in Indio</h3>
            <p>
              We travel to the Indio jail, clear security screening, and meet with the inmate in the
              designated professional visiting area. The inmate confirms their identity, signs the documents
              in our presence, and we complete the notarization with the appropriate certificate.
            </p>

            <h3>5. Document delivery</h3>
            <p>
              After the appointment, we return the signed and notarized documents to you, your attorney,
              escrow company, or other designated recipient — by hand delivery, courier, or mail depending
              on your timeline.

    <div class="service-detail-inner">
      <div class="service-detail-kicker">Common Questions</div>
      <h2>Indio Jail Notary FAQs (John J. Benoit Detention Center)</h2>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Where is the John J. Benoit Detention Center located?</h3>
        <p>
          The John J. Benoit Detention Center is located in Indio, California, serving the Coachella Valley
          communities of Indio, Palm Desert, Coachella, and surrounding areas.
        </p>

        <h3>What types of inmates are housed at the Indio jail?</h3>
        <p>
          The facility houses a mix of pre‑trial and sentenced inmates facing misdemeanor and felony charges
          out of Riverside County courts, including cases from Indio and nearby cities.
        </p>

        <h3>How do I confirm someone is at the John J. Benoit Detention Center?</h3>
        <p>
          You can use the Riverside County Sheriff’s inmate locator online or contact the county’s inmate
          information line with the person’s name and date of birth to confirm they are housed at the Indio
          facility.
        </p>

        <h3>What ID does the inmate need for notarization?</h3>
        <p>
          The facility maintains booking records with photos that can be used for identification. If the
          inmate has a valid California ID, driver’s license, or passport on file, that can also be used.
          We confirm ID options with the jail before the appointment.
        </p>

        <h3>How long does a notary appointment at the Indio jail take?</h3>
        <p>
          Because of the distance from Los Angeles and facility procedures, plan for several hours total
          including travel, security screening, wait time, and the signing itself. The notarization portion
          is quick, but logistics add time.
        </p>

        <h3>Can you handle urgent or court‑date‑driven requests at Indio?</h3>
        <p>
          In many cases, yes. If you have a court date or filing deadline, let us know when you first reach
          out. We will review travel time, facility scheduling, and our calendar to see what options are
          available.
