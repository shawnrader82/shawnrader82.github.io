            East Valley Jail is a minimum‑security facility in Thousand Oaks operated by the Ventura County
            Sheriff’s Office. It primarily houses lower‑classification inmates and those nearing release, and
            is one of the closer out‑of‑county facilities we serve from Los Angeles.

          <h3>Why East Valley inmates need notary services</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Pre‑release planning</strong> — Powers of attorney and authorizations so family can manage finances, vehicles, and property.</li>
            <li><strong>Court and legal documents</strong> — Declarations, affidavits, and other paperwork needed for active cases.</li>
            <li><strong>Family and custody matters</strong> — Guardianship, school, and childcare authorizations for children and dependents.</li>
            <li><strong>Housing and employment</strong> — Lease, employment, or benefit documents needed as part of reentry planning.</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="service-detail-note" style="margin-top:12px;">
            East Valley Jail is one of several Ventura County facilities; if the inmate is not found here, they
            may be at Ventura County Main Jail or Todd Road Jail. We confirm the correct facility before any
            visit is scheduled.

          <div class="faq-item" style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6;">
            <h3>1. Contact us with the inmate’s information</h3>
            <p>
              Call or text with the inmate’s full legal name, booking number (if known), and a description
              of the documents that need to be notarized. Let us know your deadline so we can prioritize
              scheduling.
            </p>

            <h3>2. We confirm East Valley procedures</h3>
            <p>
              Visiting schedules at East Valley Jail are set by the Ventura County Sheriff’s Office and may
              differ from other county facilities. We contact the facility at (805) 371‑8163 to confirm the
              inmate’s location and availability and coordinate a professional visit.
            </p>

            <h3>3. Prepare your documents</h3>
            <p>
              Have all documents ready and complete before the appointment — we cannot draft legal documents,
              only notarize signatures. If the inmate needs to review documents first, coordinate with their
              attorney or use the facility’s mail system.

            <h3>4. The notary appointment in Thousand Oaks</h3>
            <p>
              We travel from Los Angeles to East Valley Jail (approximately 45 minutes via US‑101), clear
              security screening, and meet with the inmate in the designated visiting area. All visitors are
              subject to search, and no cell phones, wallets, or personal items are allowed in the visiting
              area. The inmate confirms their identity, signs the documents in our presence, and we complete
              the notarization.
            </p>

            <h3>5. Document delivery</h3>
            <p>
              After the appointment, we return the signed and notarized documents to you, your attorney,
              escrow company, or other designated recipient — by hand delivery, courier, or mail depending
              on your timeline.

      <h2>East Valley Jail Notary FAQs</h2>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Where is East Valley Jail located?</h3>
        <p>
          East Valley Jail is located at 2101 E Olsen Rd, Thousand Oaks, CA 91360. It is approximately
          45 minutes from Los Angeles via US‑101.
        </p>

        <h3>How do I confirm someone is housed at East Valley Jail?</h3>
        <p>
          You can search the Ventura County Sheriff’s inmate locator online or call (805) 371‑8163.
          If the inmate is not listed at East Valley, they may be at Ventura County Main Jail or Todd Road Jail.
        </p>

        <h3>What are the visiting days and policies at East Valley Jail?</h3>
        <p>
          Visiting schedules at East Valley Jail are set by the Ventura County Sheriff’s Office and may differ
          from other county facilities. Contact the facility or call us to confirm current visiting days, times,
          and visit length or visitor limits.
        </p>

        <h3>What can I bring into East Valley Jail during a visit?</h3>
        <p>
          Only your personal key ring, photo ID, and one baby bottle or blanket if bringing an infant.
          No cell phones, wallets, purses, backpacks, food, beverages, cameras, or reading materials are allowed.
          The facility will not hold items and there are no storage lockers.
        </p>

        <h3>How is East Valley Jail different from Ventura County Main Jail or Todd Road?</h3>
        <p>
          East Valley is a minimum‑security facility that houses lower‑classification inmates and those nearing
          release. Ventura County Main Jail in Ventura primarily handles booking and pre‑trial detainees, while
          Todd Road Jail in Santa Paula primarily houses sentenced inmates in longer‑term custody.
        </p>

        <h3>How long should I plan for an East Valley Jail notary appointment?</h3>
        <p>
          Plan for 2 to 3 hours total including travel from Los Angeles (approximately 45 minutes each way via
          US‑101), security screening, wait time, and the signing.
