      <h2>Scheduling a Notary Appointment at High Desert Detention Center</h2>

      <div class="service-detail-grid">
        <div>
          <div class="faq-item" style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6;">
            <h3>1. Contact us with the inmate&#8217;s information</h3>
            <p>
              Call or text with the inmate&#8217;s full legal name, booking number (if known), and a description
              of the documents that need to be notarized. Let us know any upcoming court dates or deadlines so
              we can prioritize scheduling.
            </p>

            <h3 style="margin-top:12px;">2. We coordinate with the facility</h3>
            <p>
              High Desert Detention Center has specific procedures for professional visits that differ from public
              visiting hours. Because Adelanto is remote, we confirm scheduling, any advance approvals, and make sure
              the inmate will be available at the appointment time before we travel.
            </p>

            <h3 style="margin-top:12px;">3. Prepare your documents</h3>
            <p>
              Have all documents ready and complete before the appointment &mdash; we cannot draft legal documents,
              only notarize signatures. If the inmate needs to review documents first, coordinate with their attorney
              or mail documents to the facility in advance.
            </p>

            <h3>4. The notary appointment in Adelanto</h3>
            <p>
              We travel from the Los Angeles area to Adelanto, clear security screening at High Desert Detention
              Center, and meet with the inmate in the designated professional visiting area. The inmate confirms
              their identity, signs the documents in our presence, and we complete the notarization.
            </p>

            <h3 style="margin-top:12px;">5. Document delivery</h3>
            <p>
              After the appointment, we return the signed and notarized documents to you, your attorney, escrow company,
              or other designated recipient &mdash; by hand delivery, courier, or mail depending on your timeline.
