    <h2>What Is a Minor Travel Consent Letter?</h2>
    <p class="service-detail-lead">
      A minor travel consent letter is a signed and notarized document in which a parent or legal guardian
      grants permission for their child to travel with another adult - whether that is the other parent,
      a grandparent, a family friend, a school group, or an organized tour. It serves as proof that the
      child is not being taken without authorization.
    </p>

    <div class="service-detail-grid">
      <div>
        <h3>When You Need One</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>A child is traveling <strong>internationally</strong> with only one parent - U.S. Customs
              and Border Protection recommends a notarized consent letter from the non-traveling
              parent</li>
          <li>A child is traveling with a <strong>grandparent, relative, or family friend</strong></li>
          <li>A child is traveling <strong>alone</strong> as an unaccompanied minor on an airline</li>
          <li>A child is joining a <strong>school trip, camp, sports team, or organized tour</strong></li>
          <li>A child is traveling <strong>domestically</strong> and the accompanying adult is not
              the parent - some airlines and transportation providers request documentation</li>
          <li>A child is <strong>crossing an international border</strong> where the destination country
              requires proof of parental consent</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h3>Who Might Ask for It</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Airlines and cruise lines</strong> - may request a consent letter at check-in
              or boarding, especially for international flights</li>
          <li><strong>U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP)</strong> - recommends a notarized letter
              for any minor crossing the U.S. border without both parents</li>
          <li><strong>Foreign immigration officials</strong> - many countries require notarized or
              apostilled consent letters before allowing entry</li>
          <li><strong>Schools and youth organizations</strong> - for field trips, camps, and
              competitions</li>
          <li><strong>Hotels and resorts</strong> - some require proof of guardianship for minors
              checking in without a parent</li>

      A complete travel consent letter reduces the chance of problems at checkpoints. While there is

    <div class="service-detail-grid">
      <div>
        <h3>The Notarization Process</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>The consenting parent or guardian presents valid, current government-issued photo ID.</li>
          <li>The parent signs the letter in the presence of the notary - do not sign beforehand.</li>
          <li>The notary completes the notarial certificate (typically an <strong>acknowledgment</strong>
              or <strong>jurat</strong>, depending on the document language), applies their seal,
              and records the transaction in their journal.</li>
          <li>You receive the signed and notarized original - and a scanned copy if needed.</li>
        </ol>
        <p style="margin-top:12px; font-size:13px; color:var(--text-muted);">
          <strong>Note:</strong> Only the consenting parent or guardian needs to appear and sign.
          The child and the accompanying adult do not need to be present at the notary appointment.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h3>Do You Need an Apostille?</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Some countries require an <strong>apostille</strong> on the notarized consent letter
              before they will accept it at the border</li>
          <li>Countries that are members of the <strong>Hague Apostille Convention</strong> accept an
              apostille as proof the notarization is legitimate</li>
          <li>Countries that are <strong>not</strong> members may require a full authentication and
              legalization process through the destination country's embassy or consulate</li>
          <li>Check with the embassy or consulate of your destination country before traveling</li>

    <h2>Minor Travel Consent Letter FAQ</h2>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3>Does a child travel consent letter need to be notarized?</h3>
      <p>
        Notarization is not always legally required for domestic travel, but it is strongly recommended.
        For international travel, U.S. Customs and Border Protection recommends a notarized consent
        letter when a child is traveling without one or both parents. Many foreign countries require
        notarization, and some require an apostille as well. Airlines, cruise lines, and border agents
        are far more likely to accept a notarized letter without question.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3>What should a minor travel consent letter include?</h3>
      <p>
        A properly prepared letter should include the child's full legal name and date of birth, travel
        dates and destinations, the name and relationship of the accompanying adult, contact information
        for the consenting parent, a clear statement granting permission, and the parent's notarized
        signature. For international travel, include the child's passport number.

      <h3>What is the difference between a travel consent letter and a DS-3053?</h3>
      <p>
        A travel consent letter authorizes a child to <strong>travel</strong> with another adult. A
        DS-3053 authorizes the <strong>issuance of a U.S. passport</strong> for a child under 16 when
        one parent cannot appear at the passport office. They serve different purposes - and you may
        need both if your child does not yet have a passport.

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3>Can you create a travel consent letter at the appointment?</h3>
      <p>
        Yes. We bring a laptop, portable printer, and scanner. You can use our Rocket Lawyer account
        or any legal document platform to create the letter on the spot - then print, sign, and
        notarize in one visit.

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3>Does my travel consent letter need an apostille for international travel?</h3>
      <p>
        Some countries require an apostille on the notarized consent letter before accepting it at
        the border. Check with the embassy or consulate of your destination country. If needed, we
        offer <a href="/services/apostille.html">apostille services</a> with same or next business
        day processing.
      </p>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3>Can I get a travel consent letter notarized the same day?</h3>
      <p>
        Yes. Same-day and next-day appointments are frequently available. Travel consent letters are
        often urgent, and we prioritize getting to you quickly.
