      A bill of sale is a written document that records the transfer of ownership of property from a
      seller to a buyer. It includes the names of both parties, a description of the item, the sale
      price, and the date of the transaction. It serves as a receipt and proof of the agreement for
      both sides.

    <h2>When A Bill Of Sale Needs To Be Notarized</h2>
    <p class="service-detail-lead">
      California does not require notarization for most private-party bills of sale. However, there are
      situations where notarization is either required or strongly recommended.
    </p>

    <div class="service-detail-grid">
      <div>
        <h3>Notarization Recommended Or Required</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>The buyer is registering the item in another state that requires a notarized bill of sale.</li>
          <li>A lender or financial institution requests notarization before releasing a lien or funding.</li>
          <li>The transaction involves a replacement title or lien release.</li>
          <li>High-value items where both parties want additional legal protection.</li>
          <li>Out-of-state or international buyers who need stronger proof of purchase.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h3>California DMV Forms</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>The DMV accepts the bill of sale section on the REG 262 form or the standalone REG 135 form.</li>
          <li>Neither form requires notarization by default for standard California transfers.</li>
          <li>Having a notarized bill of sale adds a layer of protection beyond the minimum DMV requirements.</li>
          <li>If the title has been lost, a REG 227 form may be involved, and notarization may be helpful.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </div>

    <p style="font-size:12px; color:#e5e7eb; margin-top:20px; line-height:1.5;">
      <strong>Note:</strong> For standard California vehicle transfers, the DMV accepts the bill of sale
      section on the REG 262 form or the standalone REG 135 form. Neither requires notarization by
      default. However, having a notarized bill of sale adds a layer of protection beyond the minimum
      requirements.

    <h2>Bill Of Sale Notarization FAQ</h2>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3>Does a bill of sale need to be notarized in California?</h3>
      <p>
        California does not require notarization for most private vehicle or boat bills of sale. However,
        notarization is strongly recommended because it protects both the buyer and seller. Some lenders,
        out-of-state DMVs, and private parties may require or prefer a notarized copy before completing
        the transaction.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3>When is a notarized bill of sale required?</h3>
      <p>
        A notarized bill of sale may be required when the buyer is registering in another state that
        requires it, when a lender or financial institution requests it, when replacement title forms
        with liens are involved, or when the transaction is high value and both parties want extra
        protection.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3>What should a bill of sale include?</h3>
      <p>
        A proper bill of sale should include the full legal names and contact information of the buyer
        and seller, a description of the item with make, model, year, and VIN or serial number, the
        sale price and payment method, the date of sale, and signatures of both parties.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3>What type of notarization does a bill of sale require?</h3>
      <p>
        A bill of sale typically uses an acknowledgment, where both parties confirm their identities
        and that they are signing voluntarily. If the document includes sworn statements about the
        condition or history of the item, a jurat may be used instead.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3>Can a mobile notary create a bill of sale at the appointment?</h3>
      <p>
        Yes. We bring a laptop, printer, and scanner. You can use Rocket Lawyer or another legal
        document platform to create a bill of sale on the spot, then both parties sign and we notarize
        it in one visit.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3>Can I get a bill of sale notarized the same day?</h3>
      <p>
