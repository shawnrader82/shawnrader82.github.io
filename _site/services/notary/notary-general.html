    <div class="service-detail-kicker">Understanding Power of Attorney</div>
    <h2>What Is a Power of Attorney?</h2>
    <p class="service-detail-lead">
      A power of attorney (POA) is a legal document that gives one person - called the
      <strong>agent</strong> or <strong>attorney-in-fact</strong> - the authority to act on behalf of
      another person - called the <strong>principal</strong>. The principal decides exactly what powers
      to grant and can revoke them at any time while they still have mental capacity.
    </p>

    <div class="service-detail-grid">
      <div>
        <h3>Types of Power of Attorney</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>General POA</strong> - Grants broad authority over financial and legal matters;
              ends if the principal becomes incapacitated</li>
          <li><strong>Durable POA</strong> - Same broad authority, but remains in effect even if the
              principal becomes incapacitated; the most common type for long-term planning</li>
          <li><strong>Limited (Special) POA</strong> - Grants authority for a specific task or time
              period, such as selling a vehicle or signing a contract while you are out of town</li>
          <li><strong>Springing POA</strong> - Only takes effect when a specific event occurs, usually
              the principal's incapacitation as certified by a physician</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h3>Medical Power of Attorney</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Healthcare POA (Advance Healthcare Directive)</strong> - Authorizes an agent to
              make medical decisions if the principal cannot communicate their wishes</li>
          <li>Often combined with a living will that states the principal's preferences for
              end-of-life care</li>
          <li>In California, a healthcare POA has specific witness requirements - it must be notarized
              or signed by two qualifying witnesses</li>
          <li>If the principal resides in a skilled nursing facility, one witness must be a patient
              advocate or ombudsman</li>
        </ul>

    <h2>How to Notarize a Power of Attorney in California</h2>
    <p class="service-detail-lead">
      California Probate Code &sect; 4121 sets the requirements for a legally valid power of attorney.
      Here is what you need to know before your notary appointment.
    </p>

    <div class="service-detail-grid">
      <div>
        <h3>Legal Requirements</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>The POA must contain the <strong>date of its execution</strong></li>
          <li>It must be signed by the <strong>principal</strong>, or by another adult in the
              principal's presence and at their direction</li>
          <li>It must be either <strong>acknowledged before a notary public</strong> or signed by at
              least two adult witnesses (Cal. Prob. Code &sect;&sect; 4121, 4122)</li>
          <li>If the POA involves <strong>real estate</strong>, notarization is required</li>
          <li>If using a <strong>statutory form</strong>, it must be notarized</li>
          <li>The agent named in the POA <strong>cannot</strong> serve as a witness</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h3>Notarial Act &amp; What to Expect</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>A power of attorney typically requires an <strong>acknowledgment</strong> - the principal
              confirms their identity and that they are signing voluntarily</li>
          <li>The notary verifies the principal's identity using a valid, current government-issued
              photo ID</li>
          <li>The principal signs the document in the notary's presence</li>
          <li>The notary completes the acknowledgment certificate, applies their seal, and records the
              transaction in their journal</li>
          <li>California law requires the notary to obtain the principal's <strong>thumbprint</strong>
              in the journal for POA documents</li>
        </ol>
      </div>
    </div>

    <p style="font-size:12px; color:#9ca3af; margin-top:20px; line-height:1.5;">
      <strong>Note:</strong> Some POA documents include jurat language requiring the signer to swear
      under oath. The notary follows whatever notarial certificate wording is specified in the document.
      If there is a mismatch between the document language and the certificate type, the notary will
      point it out so you can decide which notarial act to use.

    <h2>Power of Attorney Notarization FAQ</h2>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3>Does a power of attorney need to be notarized in California?</h3>
      <p>
        California law requires a power of attorney to be either acknowledged before a notary public or
        signed in the presence of two adult witnesses (Cal. Prob. Code &sect;&sect; 4121, 4122). If the
        POA involves real estate or uses a statutory form, notarization is required. Notarization is
        strongly recommended for all POA types because most banks, financial institutions, and government
        agencies will only accept a notarized version.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3>What type of notarization does a power of attorney require?</h3>
      <p>
        A power of attorney typically requires an <strong>acknowledgment</strong> - the principal confirms
        their identity and that they are signing voluntarily. The notary does not administer an oath for
        an acknowledgment. Some POA documents may include jurat language; the notary follows whatever
        notarial certificate wording is specified in the document.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3>Can a mobile notary create a power of attorney document on-site?</h3>
      <p>
        We bring a laptop, portable printer, and scanner to every appointment. You can use our Rocket
        Lawyer account or any legal document platform to create your POA on the spot - then print, sign,
        and notarize in one visit. The notary does not provide legal advice; document content is chosen
        by the client.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3>How much does it cost to notarize a power of attorney in Los Angeles?</h3>
      <p>
        Mobile notary appointments for POA documents typically include a travel fee and per-signature
        notarization fee. Fees vary based on the number of signatures, time of day, and travel distance.

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3>Can the notary certify a copy of my power of attorney?</h3>
      <p>
        Yes. California notaries are authorized to certify copies of power of attorney documents. This
        is useful when you need to provide a copy to a bank, financial institution, or government agency
        while keeping the original safe. Let us know at booking and we can handle certified copies at the
        same appointment.
