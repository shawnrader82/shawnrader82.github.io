        <p class="service-detail-lead" style="margin-bottom:18px;">
          Families and businesses in Thousand Oaks and Westlake Village often split their time between local life in the
          Conejo Valley and obligations in Los Angeles, so having a mobile notary who already drives the 101 and 23 can
          save you hours when documents need to be signed correctly the first time.
        </p>
        <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:10px;">
          We regularly meet clients at homes and townhomes near Janss Marketplace and The Oaks mall, at offices and
          medical practices along Thousand Oaks Boulevard and Moorpark Road, and in Westlake Village neighborhoods around
          Westlake Lake, The Promenade at Westlake, and local golf courses for living trusts, powers of attorney, school
          forms, immigration paperwork, and business documents.
        </p>
        <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:10px;">
          Residents who enjoy the Conejo Valley's hiking trails and open space also rely on us when a signer is in a
          Ventura County or Los Angeles County jail, where documents must be signed in custody and then returned quickly
          to attorneys, courts, or family members.

          <p class="faq-question">When Conejo Valley documents need an apostille</p>
          <p class="faq-answer">
            Many Thousand Oaks and Westlake Village families maintain ties to other countries, and local professionals and
            business owners often sign powers of attorney or corporate documents that must be recognized abroad, so it is
            common for documents to require a California apostille so they are accepted without delays.
          </p>

          <p class="faq-question">Documents that may require an apostille</p>
          <p class="faq-answer">
            Typical requests include <a href="/landing/apostille-vital-birth.html">birth</a>, <a href="/landing/apostille-vital-marriage.html">marriage</a>, and <a href="/landing/apostille-vital-death.html">death certificates</a>, <a href="/landing/apostille-school-academic.html">school records and transcripts</a> for students
            studying overseas, powers of attorney for property or business interests abroad, corporate documents for
            foreign registrations, and court orders related to custody or name changes.
          </p>

          <p class="faq-question">How we guide you through the apostille process</p>
          <p class="faq-answer">
            We confirm the destination country, review the documents you already have, and explain whether they must be
            notarized first or obtained from a specific agency before an apostille can be issued, then outline realistic
            fees and timelines before you decide to move forward. For urgent cases, see our <a href="/landing/apostille-same-day-los-angeles.html">same-day apostille service</a>.

              <p class="faq-question">1. We review your documents and situation.</p>
              <p class="faq-answer">
                You can text or email photos of your powers of attorney, jail marriage forms, court documents, or other
                paperwork along with your location in Thousand Oaks or Westlake Village. We confirm what is needed, who
                must be present, facility rules, and whether any follow‑up apostille work may be required.
              </p>

              <p class="faq-question">2. We schedule a visit to the appropriate facility.</p>
              <p class="faq-answer">
                We agree on a time and plan that works for you. For jail notarizations, we coordinate visits to Ventura
                County facilities such as Todd Road Jail or the Ventura County Pre‑Trial Detention Facility, and when
                needed to Los Angeles County facilities including Pitchess Detention Center or Downtown LA jails like Men's
                Central and Twin Towers, and explain what to expect before we go.
              </p>

              <p class="faq-question">3. We complete the jail notarization and next steps.</p>
              <p class="faq-answer">
                At the facility, we verify ID according to California notary law, witness signatures, and notarize your
                documents. If the paperwork will be used in another country, we can help route it for a California
                apostille and arrange secure return or delivery once the notarization is finished.
              </p>
            </div>

            <p style="font-size:13px; color:#e5e7eb; margin-top:12px;">
              Travel and service fees for jail signings depend on the facility, number and type of documents, and timing.

        <div class="faq-block" style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6;">

          <p class="faq-question">Do you charge extra to come to Thousand Oaks or Westlake Village?</p>
          <p class="faq-answer">
            Travel fees depend on your exact location, time of day, and whether a hospital or jail visit is involved, and
            we will quote the full cost before you book so there are no surprises.
          </p>

          <p class="faq-question">Can you meet near Westlake Lake or local shopping centers?</p>
          <p class="faq-answer">
            Yes. Many clients prefer to meet near Westlake Lake, at The Promenade at Westlake, or at Thousand Oaks
            locations such as The Oaks mall or Janss Marketplace, and we can often coordinate signings around your
            schedule and parking needs in these familiar spots.
          </p>

          <p class="faq-question">Can you help if we are visiting from out of town?</p>
          <p class="faq-answer">
            Some families and professionals stay in Thousand Oaks or Westlake Village while handling court, real‑estate, or
            business matters in Los Angeles or Ventura County. We can usually coordinate mobile notary appointments and,
            when needed, follow‑up apostille work around your travel plans.
          </p>

          <p class="faq-question">What identification do we need for a mobile notary appointment?</p>
          <p class="faq-answer">
            Each signer must have valid, government-issued photo ID such as a driver's license or passport, along with all
            pages of the documents that need to be signed, and we review ID questions with you before scheduling.
          </p>

          <p class="faq-question">How do we know if an apostille will be required?</p>
          <p class="faq-answer">
            If your documents will be used in another country, they may require an apostille after issuance or
            notarization, and we can review your situation and confirm whether apostille or consular legalization is
            necessary as a separate step.
