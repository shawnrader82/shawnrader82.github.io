        <h2 style="font-size:26px; margin-bottom:10px;">Mobile notary, apostille &amp; jail support for the 118 corridor</h2>
        <p class="service-detail-lead" style="margin-bottom:18px;">
          Daily life here often involves early trains, CSUN class blocks, and shifts in studios or industrial parks along the 118, so meeting a mobile notary near home, campus, or work can be easier than carving out half a day to sit in traffic for a single signature.
        </p>
        <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:10px;">
          We regularly meet clients near the Chatsworth Metrolink Station and Old Depot Plaza, in neighborhoods below the rocky hills around Stoney Point, and throughout Northridge near CSUN, Devonshire Street, and Reseda Boulevard for living trusts, powers of attorney, school and immigration forms, and other paperwork that sometimes ends up needing an apostille for international use.
        </p>
        <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:10px;">
          Families and attorneys who live or keep offices in Chatsworth and Northridge also rely on us when a loved one is housed at Pitchess Detention Center in Castaic or at Downtown Los Angeles facilities, where documents must be signed in custody and returned quickly for court, property, or family matters.
        </p>

        <div class="faq-block" style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6;">
          <p class="faq-question">When Chatsworth &amp; Northridge documents need an apostille</p>
          <p class="faq-answer">
            Many families in Chatsworth and Northridge have relatives, property, or business interests overseas, and professionals here often work with partners in Europe, Latin America, and Asia, so documents signed locally are frequently asked to carry a California apostille before they will be accepted abroad.
          </p>

          <p class="faq-question">Local documents that may require an apostille</p>
          <p class="faq-answer">
            We commonly handle <a href="/landing/apostille-vital-birth.html">birth</a>, <a href="/landing/apostille-vital-marriage.html">marriage</a>, and <a href="/landing/apostille-vital-death.html">death certificates</a>; CSUN and other <a href="/landing/apostille-school-transcript-college.html">school transcripts</a> for students studying overseas; powers of attorney for homes or bank accounts in another country; business formation or corporate records; and court orders relating to custody, guardianship, name changes, inheritances, or property sales.
          </p>

          <p class="faq-question">How we guide you through the apostille process</p>
          <p class="faq-answer">
            We confirm which country will receive the paperwork, check that your documents are in the right form, and explain whether they must be notarized, certified, or reissued before an apostille can be added, then outline realistic fees and timelines so you can plan around travel and court or school dates. For urgent cases, see our <a href="/landing/apostille-same-day-los-angeles.html">same-day apostille service</a>.

              <p class="faq-question">1. We review your documents and situation.</p>
              <p class="faq-answer">
                You can text or email photos of your powers of attorney, jail marriage forms, court documents, or other paperwork along with your location in Chatsworth or Northridge. We confirm what is needed, who must be present, facility rules, and whether any follow‑up apostille work may be required.
              </p>

              <p class="faq-question">2. We schedule a visit from the Chatsworth–Northridge area.</p>
              <p class="faq-answer">
                We agree on a time and plan that works for you. For jail notarizations connected to Chatsworth and Northridge families, we coordinate the visit to Pitchess Detention Center near Castaic or to Downtown Los Angeles facilities such as Men's Central or Twin Towers and explain what to expect before we go.
              </p>

              <p class="faq-question">3. We complete the jail notarization and next steps.</p>
              <p class="faq-answer">
                At the facility, we verify ID according to California notary law, witness signatures, and notarize your documents. If the paperwork will be used in another country, we can help route it for a California apostille and arrange secure return or delivery once the notarization is finished.

            <p style="font-size:13px; color:#e5e7eb; margin-top:12px;">
              Travel and service fees for jail signings depend on the facility, number and type of documents, and timing. For more details, see our <a href="/landing/notary-jail-los-angeles.html" style="color:#fff; text-decoration:underline;">jail notary services page</a>.

        <div class="faq-block" style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6;">

          <p class="faq-question">Do you charge extra to come to Chatsworth or Northridge?</p>
          <p class="faq-answer">
            Travel fees depend on your exact location, time of day, and whether a hospital, school, or jail visit is involved, and we will quote the full cost before you book so there are no surprises.
          </p>

          <p class="faq-question">Can you meet near the Chatsworth Metrolink Station or CSUN?</p>
          <p class="faq-answer">
            Yes. We frequently meet clients near the Chatsworth Metrolink Station and surrounding businesses, as well as on or around the CSUN campus and nearby Northridge offices, when class schedules, parking, or train times make on‑site signings the most practical option.
          </p>

          <p class="faq-question">Can you help if we are visiting from out of town?</p>
          <p class="faq-answer">
            Many people stay in local hotels or with family near Chatsworth and Northridge while handling court, real estate, or school matters, and we can usually coordinate notary appointments and, when needed, follow‑up apostille work around your travel plans.
          </p>

          <p class="faq-question">What identification do we need for a mobile notary appointment?</p>
          <p class="faq-answer">
            Each signer must have valid, government‑issued photo ID such as a driver's license or passport, along with all pages of the documents that need to be signed, and we review ID questions with you before scheduling.
          </p>

          <p class="faq-question">How do we know if an apostille will be required?</p>
          <p class="faq-answer">
            If your documents will be used in another country, they may require an apostille or consular legalization after issuance or notarization, and we can review your situation and confirm next steps before you invest time and money.
