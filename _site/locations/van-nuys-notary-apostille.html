        <p class="service-detail-lead" style="margin-bottom:18px;">
          Van Nuys is the practical center of the Valley, with busy streets, government offices, and the airport all in
          one place, so having a mobile notary who already works around the courthouses, government center, and Van Nuys
          Boulevard means your paperwork can be handled in one focused visit instead of repeated trips across the Valley.
        </p>
        <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:10px;">
          We regularly meet clients at homes and apartments just off Van Nuys Boulevard, at offices and shops along
          Victory, Vanowen, and Sherman Way, and in and around the Van Nuys Civic Center and courthouses for living
          trusts, powers of attorney, family court forms, real‑estate documents, and business paperwork.
        </p>
        <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:10px;">
          Attorneys, businesses, and families in Van Nuys also call when someone is in custody at Pitchess Detention
          Center or Downtown LA jails and cannot appear in person, or when documents signed near the Van Nuys courthouses
          will later be filed with a consulate or used abroad and must go through the California apostille process.

          <p class="faq-question">When Van Nuys documents need an apostille</p>
          <p class="faq-answer">
            Many Van Nuys families and business owners maintain ties to other countries or sign agreements with partners
            abroad, so it is common for documents to require a California apostille so they are accepted internationally
            without delays.
          </p>

          <p class="faq-question">Documents that may require an apostille</p>
          <p class="faq-answer">
            For Van Nuys clients, common requests include <a href="/landing/apostille-vital-birth.html">birth</a>, <a href="/landing/apostille-vital-marriage.html">marriage</a>, and <a href="/landing/apostille-vital-death.html">death certificates</a>, DMV or insurance
            documents tied to out‑of‑country drivers, <a href="/landing/apostille-school-academic.html">school records</a> for international students, powers of attorney for
            overseas property or business interests, and court orders involving custody or name changes.
          </p>

          <p class="faq-question">How we guide you through the apostille process</p>
          <p class="faq-answer">
            We confirm the destination country, review the documents you already have, and explain whether they must be
            notarized first or obtained from a specific agency before an apostille can be issued, then outline realistic
            fees and timelines before you decide to move forward. For urgent cases, see our <a href="/landing/apostille-same-day-los-angeles.html">same-day apostille service</a>.

              <p class="faq-question">1. We review your documents and situation.</p>
              <p class="faq-answer">
                You can text or email photos of your powers of attorney, jail marriage forms, court documents, or other
                paperwork along with your location in Van Nuys. We confirm what is needed, who must be present, facility
                rules, and whether any follow‑up apostille work may be required.
              </p>

              <p class="faq-question">2. We schedule a visit from Van Nuys.</p>
              <p class="faq-answer">
                We agree on a time and plan that works for you. For cases that start in Van Nuys but involve someone
                housed at Pitchess Detention Center in Castaic or a Downtown Los Angeles jail, we coordinate the visit to
                the appropriate facility and explain what to expect before we go.
              </p>

              <p class="faq-question">3. We complete the jail notarization and next steps.</p>
              <p class="faq-answer">
                At the facility, we verify ID according to California notary law, witness signatures, and notarize your
                documents. If the paperwork will be used in another country, we can help route it for a California
                apostille and arrange secure return or delivery once the notarization is finished.
              </p>
            </div>

            <p style="font-size:13px; color:#e5e7eb; margin-top:12px;">
              Travel and service fees for jail signings depend on the facility, number and type of documents, and timing.

        <div class="faq-block" style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6;">

          <p class="faq-question">Do you charge extra to come to Van Nuys?</p>
          <p class="faq-answer">
            Travel fees vary based on where we're meeting you, the time of day, and whether a hospital or jail visit is
            involved, and we go over the total cost—including travel and any expected waiting time—before you decide to
            schedule.
          </p>

          <p class="faq-question">Can you meet near the Van Nuys courthouse or civic center?</p>
          <p class="faq-answer">
            Yes. Many clients prefer to meet near the Van Nuys Civic Center, at offices along Van Nuys Boulevard, or close
            to the courthouse and nearby parking, and we can often coordinate signings around your schedule and hearing
            times.
          </p>

          <p class="faq-question">Can you help if we are visiting from out of town or flying through Van Nuys Airport?</p>
          <p class="faq-answer">
            Some clients arrive via Van Nuys Airport or stay in nearby hotels while handling court, real‑estate, or
            business matters. We can usually coordinate mobile notary appointments and, when needed, follow‑up apostille
            work around your travel plans.
          </p>

          <p class="faq-question">What identification do we need for a mobile notary appointment?</p>
          <p class="faq-answer">
            Each signer must have valid, government-issued photo ID such as a driver's license or passport, along with all
            pages of the documents that need to be signed, and we review ID questions with you before scheduling.
          </p>

          <p class="faq-question">How do we know if an apostille will be required?</p>
          <p class="faq-answer">
            If your documents will be used in another country, they may require an apostille after issuance or
            notarization, and we can review your situation and confirm whether apostille or consular legalization is
            necessary as a separate step.
