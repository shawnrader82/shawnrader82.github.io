        <p class="service-detail-lead" style="margin-bottom:18px;">
          Life in Sherman Oaks and Studio City often revolves around Ventura Boulevard, the 101 and 405, and nearby
          studios and office buildings, so having a mobile notary who already works this corridor can save you time when
          documents need to be signed correctly on a deadline.
        </p>
        <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:10px;">
          We regularly meet clients at homes and apartments above Ventura Boulevard, at offices and medical practices near
          the Sherman Oaks Galleria and "The Village at Sherman Oaks," and in Studio City neighborhoods that border
          Universal City and Radford Studios for living trusts, powers of attorney, production and business paperwork,
          immigration and school forms, and union or guild‑related documents.
        </p>
        <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:10px;">
          Writers, producers, and crew who split their time between offices, stages, and home also call us when a signer
          is in the hospital or in custody at Pitchess or Downtown LA facilities, where documents must be signed in
          person and returned quickly to attorneys, networks, or families.

          <p class="faq-question">When documents from this area need an apostille</p>
          <p class="faq-answer">
            Many Sherman Oaks and Studio City families have ties overseas, and entertainment and business professionals
            here regularly sign contracts, powers of attorney, and corporate resolutions that must be recognized
            internationally, so it is common for documents to require a California apostille so they are accepted abroad without delays.
          </p>

          <p class="faq-question">Documents that may require an apostille</p>
          <p class="faq-answer">
            Typical requests include <a href="/services/apostille/vital-birth.html">birth</a>, <a href="/services/apostille/vital-marriage.html">marriage</a>, and <a href="/services/apostille/vital-death.html">death certificates</a>, <a href="/services/apostille/school-academic.html">school records and transcripts</a> for students
            studying overseas, powers of attorney for property or business interests abroad, corporate documents for
            foreign registrations, and court orders related to custody, name changes, or production‑related entities.
          </p>

          <p class="faq-question">How we guide you through the apostille process</p>
          <p class="faq-answer">
            We confirm the destination country, review the documents you already have, and explain whether they must be
            notarized first or obtained from a specific agency before an apostille can be issued, then outline realistic
            fees and timelines so you can plan around shoot days, work travel, or family schedules. For urgent cases, see our <a href="/services/apostille/same-day-los-angeles.html">same-day apostille service</a>.

              <p class="faq-question">1. We review your documents and situation.</p>
              <p class="faq-answer">
                You can text or email photos of your powers of attorney, jail marriage forms, court documents, or other
                paperwork along with your location in Sherman Oaks or Studio City. We confirm what is needed, who must be
                present, facility rules, and whether any follow‑up apostille work may be required.
              </p>

              <p class="faq-question">2. We schedule a visit from the Ventura Boulevard area.</p>
              <p class="faq-answer">
                We agree on a time and plan that works for you. For jail notarizations connected to Sherman Oaks and
                Studio City families, we coordinate the visit to Pitchess Detention Center near Castaic or to Downtown Los
                Angeles facilities such as Men's Central Jail or Twin Towers and explain what to expect before we go.
              </p>

              <p class="faq-question">3. We complete the jail notarization and next steps.</p>
              <p class="faq-answer">
                At the facility, we verify ID according to California notary law, witness signatures, and notarize your
                documents. If the paperwork will be used in another country, we can help route it for a California
                apostille and arrange secure return or delivery once the notarization is finished.
              </p>
            </div>

            <p style="font-size:13px; color:#e5e7eb; margin-top:12px;">
              Travel and service fees for jail signings depend on the facility, number and type of documents, and timing.

          <p class="faq-question">Do you charge extra to come to Sherman Oaks or Studio City?</p>
          <p class="faq-answer">
            Travel fees depend on your exact location, time of day, and whether a hospital or jail visit is involved, and
            we will quote the full cost before you book so there are no surprises.
          </p>

          <p class="faq-question">Can you meet along Ventura Boulevard or at the Galleria?</p>
          <p class="faq-answer">
            Yes. Many clients prefer to meet at the Sherman Oaks Galleria, along Ventura Boulevard's restaurants and
            offices, or near Studio City's Metro station and nearby streets, and we can often coordinate signings around
            your schedule and parking needs in these busy but familiar spots.
          </p>

          <p class="faq-question">Can you help if we are visiting from out of town or in town for a production?</p>
          <p class="faq-answer">
            People often stay in Sherman Oaks and Studio City while working on productions or handling business in Los
            Angeles. We can usually coordinate mobile notary appointments and, when needed, follow‑up apostille work
            around your production or travel schedule.
          </p>

          <p class="faq-question">What identification do we need for a mobile notary appointment?</p>
          <p class="faq-answer">
            Each signer must have valid, government-issued photo ID such as a driver's license or passport, along with all
            pages of the documents that need to be signed, and we review ID questions with you before scheduling.
          </p>

          <p class="faq-question">How do we know if an apostille will be required?</p>
          <p class="faq-answer">
            If your documents will be used in another country, they may require an apostille after issuance or
            notarization, and we can review your situation and confirm whether apostille or consular legalization is
            necessary as a separate step.
