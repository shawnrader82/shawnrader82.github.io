        Mobile notary help for Beverly Hills homes, offices, and clinics
      </h2>
      <p class="service-detail-lead" style="margin-bottom:18px;">
        Many Beverly Hills clients split their time between home, medical appointments, and work in law, finance,
        real estate, and entertainment, which makes it difficult to fit in a traditional notary visit.
      </p>
      <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:10px;">
        We travel to residences north and south of Santa Monica Boulevard, medical and dental offices, law firms
        around the Triangle, and corporate suites near Wilshire and Olympic so you can sign documents where you are
        without worrying about parking, traffic, or office lobby wait times.
      </p>
      <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:10px;">
        If your paperwork will later be sent overseas, used in court, or involves someone in custody, we can also
        plan any California apostille or jail notarization steps up front so there are fewer delays and repeat visits.

            <p class="faq-question">1. Share your documents and location.</p>
            <p class="faq-answer">
              You can text or email photos or PDFs of your documents along with your address in Beverly Hills or
              nearby Century City and any timing restrictions from work, family, or medical appointments.
            </p>

            <p class="faq-question">2. We confirm requirements and quote fees.</p>
            <p class="faq-answer">
              We review ID and witnessing rules, check whether your paperwork may later need an apostille or jail
              visit, and send a clear quote that includes travel, parking, and any after‑hours or rush options.
            </p>

            <p class="faq-question">3. We come to you and complete the notarization.</p>
            <p class="faq-answer">
              A commissioned mobile notary meets you at home, in an office, at a medical facility, or in another
              agreed‑upon location, verifies identity under California law, and completes the notarization so you can
              move on with your day.

          <p class="service-detail-lead" style="margin-top:14px; max-width:640px;">
            When needed, we can also coordinate follow‑up apostille work and delivery so documents reach attorneys,
            courts, or out‑of‑country contacts on schedule. For urgent cases, see our

      <div class="faq-block" style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6;">
        <p class="faq-question">Do you charge extra to come to Beverly Hills?</p>
        <p class="faq-answer">
          Travel fees depend on your exact location, time of day, parking or building access, and whether a hospital or
          jail visit is involved. We always quote the full cost before you book so there are no surprises.
        </p>

        <p class="faq-question">Can you meet in our home, office, or medical suite?</p>
        <p class="faq-answer">
          Yes. We regularly meet clients in private homes, law and finance offices, medical and dental practices, and
          other professional suites throughout Beverly Hills and nearby Century City.
        </p>

        <p class="faq-question">Can you work with my attorney or advisor?</p>
        <p class="faq-answer">
          We are happy to coordinate with your attorney, financial advisor, or family‑office team to make sure
          documents are prepared correctly and signed in the right order before we arrive.
        </p>

        <p class="faq-question">How do we know if an apostille will be required?</p>
        <p class="faq-answer">
          If your documents will be used in another country, they may need a California apostille or consular
          legalization. We can review your situation and confirm the right path before you invest time and money.
        </p>

        <p class="faq-question">What identification do signers need?</p>
        <p class="faq-answer">
          Each signer must have valid, government‑issued photo ID such as a driver's license, state ID, or passport,
          along with all pages of the documents that need to be signed. We are happy to answer ID questions before we
          schedule.
