        <p class="service-detail-lead" style="margin-bottom:18px;">
          Life in Burbank and Glendale often revolves around production schedules, clinic visits, and school calendars as much as 5 and 134 traffic, so having a mobile notary who already works inside this studio and medical corridor makes it easier to handle paperwork without stepping away from set, office, or family for half a day.
        </p>
        <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:10px;">
          We regularly meet clients at homes and apartments near Downtown Burbank, Magnolia Park, and the Media District, in Glendale neighborhoods above Brand and Glenoaks, and at offices near the studios, hospitals, and shopping districts when people need living trusts, powers of attorney, immigration forms, school records, or production and business documents notarized.
        </p>
        <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:10px;">
          Families, creatives, and business owners in Burbank and Glendale also call when a signer is housed at Pitchess Detention Center or a Downtown LA jail, or when documents signed here will travel abroad and must carry a California apostille so courts, schools, or foreign partners will accept them without delays.
        </p>

          <p class="faq-question">When Burbank &amp; Glendale documents need an apostille</p>
          <p class="faq-answer">
            In Burbank and Glendale, it is common for families to have relatives abroad and for studios and tech companies to work across borders, so documents signed here often need a California apostille or similar certification before embassies, schools, or foreign counterparts will accept them.
          </p>

          <p class="faq-question">Local documents that may require an apostille</p>
          <p class="faq-answer">
            We frequently see <a href="/landing/apostille-vital-birth.html">birth</a>, <a href="/landing/apostille-vital-marriage.html">marriage</a>, and <a href="/landing/apostille-vital-death.html">death certificates</a>, dual‑citizenship and immigration records, <a href="/landing/apostille-school-academic.html">school transcripts</a> for students studying film or animation overseas, powers of attorney for property or royalties abroad, production and distribution agreements, and court orders involving custody, adoption, or name changes.
          </p>

          <p class="faq-question">How we guide you through the apostille process</p>
          <p class="faq-answer">
            We identify the destination country, review the exact documents you have, and explain whether they must be notarized, certified, or reissued before an apostille can be attached, then map out realistic fees, timelines, and any consulate or courier steps so you can plan around work and travel.

              <p class="faq-question">When a signer is in custody but family is in the foothills</p>
              <p class="faq-answer">
                Families and attorneys based in Burbank and Glendale often need jail notarizations when a loved one is housed at Pitchess Detention Center near Castaic or at Downtown Los Angeles facilities such as Men's Central Jail or Twin Towers, where documents must be signed inside the facility and brought back quickly for court or property matters.
              </p>

              <p class="faq-question">How we handle jail signings from this area</p>
              <p class="faq-answer">
                We start by reviewing your powers of attorney, jail marriage forms, or other documents and confirming booking details and facility rules. From there we schedule the visit, travel from the Burbank–Glendale area to the jail, verify identity under California notary law, witness the signing, and return the documents to you or your attorney.
              </p>

              <p class="faq-question">If your documents will be used in another country</p>
              <p class="faq-answer">
                When paperwork signed in custody will ultimately be filed with a foreign court or authority, we can help arrange the follow‑up California apostille or consular legalization and organize secure delivery once all signatures and notarial certificates are complete.
              </p>
            </div>

            <p style="font-size:13px; color:#e5e7eb; margin-top:12px;">
              Travel and service fees for jail signings depend on the facility, number and type of documents, and timing. For more details, see our <a href="/landing/notary-jail-los-angeles.html" style="color:#fff; text-decoration:underline;">jail notary services page</a>.

        <div class="faq-block" style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6;">

          <p class="faq-question">Do you charge extra to come to Burbank or Glendale?</p>
          <p class="faq-answer">
            Travel fees depend on your exact location, time of day, and whether a hospital, studio, or jail visit is involved, and we will quote the full cost before you book so there are no surprises.
          </p>

          <p class="faq-question">Can you meet at a studio, office, or shopping area?</p>
          <p class="faq-answer">
            Yes. We often meet clients at Burbank studios and production offices, in Downtown Burbank, or near the Glendale Galleria and Americana at Brand when it is easier to sign between work, errands, or filming than at home.
          </p>

          <p class="faq-question">Can you help if we are visiting from out of town?</p>
          <p class="faq-answer">
            Many people stay in Burbank or Glendale hotels while handling court, production, or business matters in Los Angeles, and we can usually coordinate notary appointments and, when needed, follow‑up apostille work around tight travel schedules.
          </p>

          <p class="faq-question">What identification do we need for a mobile notary appointment?</p>
          <p class="faq-answer">
            Each signer must have valid, government‑issued photo ID such as a driver's license or passport, along with all pages of the documents that need to be signed, and we review ID questions with you before scheduling.
          </p>

          <p class="faq-question">How do we know if an apostille will be required?</p>
          <p class="faq-answer">
            If your documents will be used in another country, they may require an apostille or consular legalization after issuance or notarization, and we can review your situation and confirm next steps before you invest time and money.
